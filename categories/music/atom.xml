    <id>http://blog.thomasupton.com/2016/01/my-favorite-albums-of-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This list is a little late, but when a contender for a top album of the year comes out on December 18, I like to wait until the actual new year to pare down the list. There’s no way that I could choose a “traditional” top ten. I had such a long list of amazing music that I listened to this year that even when I culled it to the things that were released this year I still had far too many.</p>

<p>I managed to come up with a healthy list of “top” albums and a few more “honorable mentions,” but really everything on this list is a favorite thing of mine from this year. This isn’t a “best of” list or anything of the sort. The albums aren’t in any order whatsoever and there are purposefully no numbers next to the list that follows. I tried to include a song and write a little blurb about my picks but really they are my favorite <em>albums</em> of the past year and are meant to be enjoyed as such.</p>

<h2 id="favorite-albums">Favorite Albums</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Panopticon — <em>Autumn Eternal</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=572749934/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2463597583/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://thetruepanopticon.bandcamp.com/album/autumn-eternal">Autumn Eternal by Panopticon</a></iframe>

    <p>I discovered this one late, just like Panopticon’s previous release, while reading <a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1846829/the-50-best-metal-albums-of-2015/franchises/2015-in-review/">Stereogum’s list of the top metal albums of 2015</a>. There are some great records there, so go check that out if the heavier records on the rest of my list interest you.</p>

    <p>The album’s namesake track is a standout, but really the entire album is meant to be enjoyed at once. The Southern infusions apparent on Austin Lunn’s previous releases as Panopticon have mostly been replaced with colder, darker Midwestern roots – he moved from Kentucky to Minnesota recently – and that results in a heavier, colder sound.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Baroness — <em>Purple</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFQpxWBznVs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>The fact that this album was just released less than two weeks ago doesn’t mean it’s not a contender for best of the year. The songwriting is top-notch and the riffage is heavier than ever. It’s so cool to see these guys back touring and writing music after their much-talked-about bus accident in 2014. The energy and emotion (and positivity!) on display on this record is clearly a direct result of the aftermath of that experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cult Leader — <em>Lightless Walk</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2270733760/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=71347503/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://cultleadermusic.bandcamp.com/album/lightless-walk">Lightless Walk by Cult Leader</a></iframe>

    <p>From the moment the first note hits, you know this record is going to be brutal. That detuning chord makes your stomach drop, too, and “Great I Am” bursts through the subterranean cavern it just dug. It only gets more gut-wrenching from there. It’s not all just a bash-your-head-into-the-wall-of-sound experience though; there’s a dynamic on record that makes the restrained parts more beautiful and the chaotic parts uglier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Kowloon Walled City — <em>Grievances</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=527447037/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3145765584/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://kowloonwalledcity.bandcamp.com/album/grievances">Grievances by Kowloon Walled City</a></iframe>

    <p>Slow, slower, slowest. I love that the production of this album is a first-class instrument. This <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_us/blog/kurt-ballou-kowloon-walled-city-interview-stream">conversation between guitarist and producer Scott Evans and Converge’s Kurt Ballou</a> is a great read and offers some insight into the process of producing one’s own album.</p>

    <p>The song-writing is top-notch here. Heavy is not always about the riffage.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alabama Shakes — <em>Sound &amp; Color</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faG8RiaANek" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>Better production, fame, and an Apple ad feature don’t diminsh the soul and feel on display in this record. Every song is a microcosm of Alabama Shakes: big vocals, Southern instrumentals, a strong rhythm section, and lots and lots of emotion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deafheaven — <em>New Bermuda</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1209678071/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2698513669/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://deafheavens.bandcamp.com/album/new-bermuda">New Bermuda by deafheaven</a></iframe>

    <p><a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1831360/premature-evaluation-deafheaven-new-bermuda/franchises/premature-evaluation/">So much has been written about Deafheaven</a> <a href="http://www.spin.com/featured/deafheaven-2015-band-of-the-year-new-bermuda-interview/">this year</a>, and it’s all better and more eloquent than anything I could write here. Seriously, read that Stereogum review.</p>

    <p>The bottom line is that this record is the exact opposite of what everyone, including me, expected a followup to <em>Sunbather</em> to sound like. It’s heavier, dirtier, harsher, more emotional, and – yes – better than Deafheaven’s previous effort. The heavier parts are fuller, and the shoegaze-y post-rock-y parts are more soaring and beautiful than ever. I can’t wait to see where Deafheaven goes from here, but for now I’m content to listen to <em>New Bermuda</em> over and over and over.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intronaut — <em>The Direction of Last Things</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jc9mfvBZxdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>“The Pleasant Surprise” is exactly apt for this record: I knew that Intronaut had a new album due out soon, but it was indeed a pleasant surprise in November when this album dropped. These songs have that signature Intronaut sound; the impeccable drumming, the funky basslines, and of course the great guitar work are all on display. But these songs are tighter than ever. The album starts with a ripper, then mellows out slightly, but the chops and intensity never let up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mutoid Man — <em>Bleeder</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4012094723/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3917771404/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://mutoidman.bandcamp.com/album/bleeder">Bleeder by Mutoid Man</a></iframe>

    <p>I had the pleasure of seeing Mutoid Man live twice this year: once in a brand new intimate venue on Red River, and once in a festival setting at Fun Fun Fun Fest. Mutoid Man are the rare band that excel in both environments. They just seem to have so much (dirty sweaty) fun playing, and it shows in this new set of songs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cloudkicker — <em>Woum</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=305201338/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1759093302/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://cloudkickermusic.com/album/woum">Woum by Cloudkicker</a></iframe>

    <p>The influence of touring with Intronaut is apparent here: this sounds like the perfect mix of the mellower Intronaut sections and Ben Sharp’s impeccable guitar and production chops. I always look forward to new music from Cloudkicker, not least of all because I know it will be different and surprising and amazing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Loma Prieta — <em>Self Portrait</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=618448284/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1770677805/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://lomaprietaband.bandcamp.com/album/self-portrait">Self Portrait by Loma Prieta</a></iframe>

    <p>This album is weirdly lo-fi in terms of production, but somehow it works. “Satellite” is a bit of a departure from their usual sound, but it still maintains the chaos without being quite as traditionally “heavy”. I haven’t seen a whole lot of press about Loma Prieta recently, but I know they’re touring with some success. This is a band that I have yet to see live, but I really want to hear these songs in person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Foals — <em>What Went Down</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-n4U2KZZVs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>I love everything about Foals. Everyone says this is the album that cemented them as an “arena rock” band, but their hooks have been huge for a while now. Fame and bigger venues hasn’t diminished the catchiness and unbelievable tightness of this band.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rivers of Nihil — <em>Monarchy</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=403551485/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1753787207/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://riversofnihil.bandcamp.com/album/monarchy">Monarchy by Rivers of Nihil</a></iframe>

    <p>Vocals are not what I usually focus on when listening to music, and that’s especially true for heavy music, but the vocal style and production on display on <em>Monarchy</em> is just perfect. It helps that the music behind those vocals is tight and nasty, too. This is a band that I discovered this year. I’m ashamed so say that I kind of dismissed them at first based on their name and album cover; it seemed just a little cheesy to me. I quickly got past that from the moment the album starts. The title track really showcases this band’s sound – that great vocal production, technical guitar solos, breakneck drums – so listen to it above and then listen to the whole album.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vattnet Viskar — <em>Settler</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrFxKXtkPfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>Vattnet Viskar is a strange name for a band from New Hampshire – it <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18504-vattnet-viskar-sky-swallower/">means “the water whispers” in Swedish</a> – and it certainly paints a picture before the first note is heard. Forget whatever you think from the band’s name and <em>Settler</em>’s <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20601-settler/">album cover</a>; this is American black metal at its finest. Comparisons to <em>Sunbather</em> are inevitable, but this is grittier and muddier and dirtier.</p>

    <p>A note unrelated to the content of this album: it was very hard to find this album; it seemed to go in and out of availability on streaming services. It’s available on iTunes now though, and hopefully it’s here to stay.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Between the Buried and Me — <em>Coma Ecliptic</em></strong></p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEpu2keRMwI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>More prog, less growls, and the amazing chops that we all know and love. This band keeps getting better and better. <em>Colors</em> is a nearly perfect album, and here we are four releases later to see that they have evolved their sound and found their pocket of prog metal that no one else can match. If you have not yet had the chance to see these guys live, make it your top priority when they next tour near you. They somehow manage to sound better live, which is a rare feat amongst bands in this genre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Armed — <em>Untitled</em></strong></p>

    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1917919728/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=389904254/transparent=true/" seamless=""><a href="http://thearmed.bandcamp.com/album/untitled">Untitled by The Armed</a></iframe>

    <p>Another album from a new-to-me-this-year band. I listen to this when I’m running and when I need to tune absolutely everything else out while working. It’s cathartically brutal and mindless in the best way possible. A side note: how does Nick Yacyshyn find the time to play drums for all of these bands?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Beach House — <em>Thank Your Lucky Stars</em></strong></p>

    <p>A “surprise” album that was even better than the one it definitely wasn’t a companion to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Napalm Death — <em>Apex Predator - Easy Meat</em></strong></p>

    <p>Napalm Death, or <a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1728139/napalm-death-how-the-years-condemn-stereogum-premiere/mp3s/">this incarnation of it</a>, is on point. Seriously, how does a thirty year old band put our their best material at this point in their career?</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>From First To Last — <em>Dead Trees</em></strong></p>

    <p>Maybe I’m biased because I backed this album on Kickstarter. Spencer Soletto’s vocals are a perfect match for FFTL’s heaviest and catchiest effort to date.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Battles — <em>La Di Da Di</em></strong></p>

    <p>Weirder than ever, which is definitely a good thing. And I still haven’t seen these guys live…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Courtney Barnett — <em>Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit</em></strong></p>

    <p>Great songwriting on display here. I love the refreshing take on “indie rock”; it’s kind of dirty and poppy at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Theories — <em>Regression</em></strong></p>

    <p>I found this band via the seemingly-endless stream of emails that Metal Blade sends. For some reason, this one stuck. “Burnt Concrete” is such a bangin’ opener.</p>

    <p><sup><em>And for the record, I read and enjoy most of those Metal Blade emails; that wasn’t a complaint.</em></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CHON — <em>Grow</em></strong></p>

    <p>CHON is definitely best experienced live, but this album is as good a facsimile as you can get of that experience. I do wish they’d try to play some of the songs with vocals live, but I’m content with their ridiculous instrumental chops. These guys are so young and fresh, too, so I can’t wait to see what comes next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>All Get Out — <em>Movement</em></strong></p>

    <p>I listened to this EP countless times when it came out. I have a feeling that their upcoming LP will make next year’s list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blanck Mass — <em>Dumb Flesh</em></strong></p>

    <p>Such a weird album, but I expect nothing less from one half of Fuck Buttons. I love the musical experimentation on display here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sumac — <em>The Deal</em></strong></p>

    <p>How can I not mention this supergroup made up of members of Baptists, Old Man Gloom, and Russian Circles? Weird and heavy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://blog.thomasupton.com/2012/08/batch-deleting-last-fm-scrobbles"/>
    <updated>2012-08-12T20:06:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.thomasupton.com/2012/08/batch-deleting-last-fm-scrobbles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently came home from a trip and synced my iPhone in iTunes in an attempt to scrobble the music
that I listened to on that trip. I use <a href="http://meloapp.com/faq/">Melo</a> to scrobble tracks played in iTunes, and it usually
works quite well because I never know it’s there.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure if Melo, iTunes, or <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> is to blame, but I ended up with a large amount of
scrobbles from a repeated handful of songs. I have over 75,000 tracks scrobbled in Last.fm, but I
use their recommendations and like to look at my stats, so artificially inflating my scrobble
count with three artists was extremely undesirable.</p>

<p>I had 59 pages of unwanted scrobbles; I needed to quickly delete nearly 3000 scrobbles. Last.fm
doesn’t have a way to batch delete (or otherwise manage) your scrobble tracks, so I manually clicked
all the delete links on the first page.</p>

<p>That got old before I had even deleted ten scrobbles. I figured out a way to programmatically and
quickly delete a page of scrobbles. I still have to manually get to each page, but this makes it
much easier.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>UPDATE 2017-05-08</em>:</p>

<p>Thanks to a reader, I was informed that the site design has changed yet again, requiring a new selector for the delete button. The new code should now be as follows (thanks AN!):</p>

<p><code>javascript
jQuery('.chartlist button.dropdown-menu-clickable-item[type="submit"]').each(_, c) {
    c.click();
});
</code></p>

<p>Again, I’ll leave the old code up for posterity.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>UPDATE 2015-10-08</em>:</p>

<p>Since the new Last.fm redesign recently went live after being in beta for a while, it looks like the selector in the above code needs to change. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jayholler/status/652226890338439168">@jayholler</a>, the code should now be:</p>

<p><code>javascript
jQuery('.chartlist button.chartlist-delete-button').each(function(_, b) {
    b.click();
});
</code></p>

<p>I am leaving the old code up for posterity and just in case the old site is still accessible somewehere.</p>

<hr />

<p><code>javascript
jQuery('#deletablert a.delete').each(function(_, a) {
    a.click();
});
</code></p>

<p>I just open up the console with <code>⌘-⌥-I</code>, paste in that snippet of code, and hit enter. Here is what
it looks like in action.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7770297078_73fafc7541_o_d.png" alt="Batch deleting Last.fm scrobbles." title="Last.fm Batch Delete" /></p>

<p>Since <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is already embedded in Last.fm’s pages, I just select all the delete links and
emit a click on each one. The entire page is deleted in a few seconds. When it’s done, I can click
the link to the previous page and repeat.</p>

<p>I don’t expect this will be very useful to anyone but myself for the next ten minutes, but it could
come in handy in case you’ve been listening to too much Carly Rae Jepsen.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.thomasupton.com/2011/12/my-ten-favorite-albums-of-2011"/>
    <updated>2011-12-21T09:31:58-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.thomasupton.com/2011/12/my-ten-favorite-albums-of-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="a-musical-year">A Musical Year</h2>

<p>Music has been a huge part of my life for a long time now. I started playing the violin in the fourth grade. I played the saxophone for six years, including for four years in my high school marching band. I played in a punk rock band with my best friends from high school for four years. The next and latest chapter of my musical life began when I moved to Austin, TX in June of 2010.</p>

<p>They call Austin the “Live Music Capital of the World”. To many, that sounds like exaggeration and a desperate grasp at something to be proud of. To those who have experienced it, it is almost an understatement. Whether you’ve been punched in the gut in the pit at Emo’s or just seen that gnarly rocker chick band Guilty Pleasures while walking past Thirsty Nickel on a Saturday night, there’s no denying that music is in the blood of Austin. I love it.</p>

<p>2011 was a musical year for me. According to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/events/2011">Last.fm</a>, I went to 46 musical events, including SXSW, ACL, and FFFFest. And that doesn’t count the numerous times I caught local acts on the weekends. Some might have thought of 2011 as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10100626303464693&id;=6206637">lackluster</a> year for music, but I disagree. There were some fantastic releases by some great bands; old favorites thanked their fans with fresh material and new (but sometimes only new to me) acts dug their way into my ears and heart.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-medium">A New Medium</h3>

<p>There is something else that affected my music listening habits in 2011: <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a>. I signed up in July and immediately started listening to tons of new music. In November, I listened to at least one new album each day as part of Month of New Music (see my <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thomasupton/status/142345008454959105">#monm playlist</a>.) Rdio tore down any remaining barriers that hindered listening to any music, anywhere, quickly. I chose Rdio over <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> for a few reasons: Rdio has better social features, better recommendations, a similarly-sized catalogue, better apps on both the desktop and mobile, and a better blog filled with interviews with musicians, reviews, and recommendations.</p>

<p>According to iTunes, I have seventy one albums that were released in 2011. This is lower than any other year that I have been adding music to iTunes, but that is explained by my prolific use of Rdio. I have purchased a few albums after streaming them, but Rdio is almost like having a second library. I briefly looked for statistics on Rdio listening habits, but I couldn’t find any. Believe me when I say I listen to a ton of music every day while working.</p>

<p>I made a list of nineteen albums that were my favorites of the year. I’ve pared it down to ten that I want to talk about, but I’ll mention the others at the end. All in all, it was a great year of music for me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="running-from-a-gamble-by-company-of-thieves">Running From a Gamble by Company of Thieves</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/company-of-thieves-running-from-a-gamble.jpg" alt="Running From a Gamble by Company of Thieves" /></p>

<p>Genevieve Schatz can sing. She has a huge voice, especially for such a small, unassuming person. She’s backed by a band that can simultaneously rock out and complement her vocals. This is a poppy album, but it’s filled with soul <em>and</em> rock. The first song I heard from <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUCYo"><em>Running from a Gamble</em></a> was the incredible “Death of Communication.” From a simple beginning, it quickly builds into a spunky anthem. The outro to that song leaves you wanting more, and more is what you get on <em>Gamble</em>. Every song has character, with lots of soul and even blues influences. See this band live and stand in awe.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="barton-hollow-by-the-civil-wars">Barton Hollow by The Civil Wars</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/the-civil-wars-barton-hollow.jpg" alt="Barton Hollow by The Civil Wars" /></p>

<p>If you had asked me five years ago if I would ever pick a folk or country-influenced album to put on my list of favorites from the past year, I would have laughed. Then I heard <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJRNEE"><em>Barton Hollow</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a silly and meaningless (to everyone but me) story, but I’ll recount it anyway. I was at a friend’s house for a party over the summer. I had traveled halfway across the country to go, so I was staying over and was the only one left the next day. I have a tradition to trade music with this friend whenever we meet up, so he gave me a number of albums and told me to check one or two of them out while he went to take care of some errands. I just picked <em>Barton Hollow</em> by chance. I put it on and laid down on the bed and just stared at the ceiling and listened to the entire album. It’s so calming and soothing, and it was perfect for that moment.</p>

<p>I’ve since listened to this album many times. Both members of this band can sing incredibly well, and their song-writing and story-telling skills are second to none. The vocals are certainly the focal point of The Civil Wars’ music, but the guitar picking and occasional percussion are nothing to scoff at. This is beautiful music.</p>

<h2 id="the-king-of-limbs-by-radiohead">The King of Limbs by Radiohead</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/radiohead-the-king-of-limbs.jpg" alt="The King of Limbs by Radiohead" /></p>

<p>I’ll never understand why <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJSzO0"><em>The King of Limbs</em></a> was poorly received by both critics and fans alike. I tend not to compare Radiohead releases to each other — <em>Kid A</em> is one of my favorite albums, but it doesn’t mean I like it any <em>better</em> than <em>OK Computer</em> or <em>Hail to the Thief</em>, it just means that I enjoy it for what it is and how it makes me feel in comparison to other albums that are not made my crazy Englishmen.</p>

<p>Radiohead is definitely a band all about feel. <em>Limbs</em> seems to have more of an electronic feel to it. There are little “glitches” on the tracks, the percussion is so precise that it’s almost robotic, and synths are prevalent. Radiohead has always had hints of this kind of thing since early on, but it’s out in the open here.</p>

<p>The band released a set of remixes of the album throughout the year, and they actually serve to show how great the album is: each one of these songs can and is interpreted in a number of ways.</p>

<p>I love the muted guitar on “Morning Mr Magpie” and the haunting lyrics of the aptly-named “Give Up The Ghost”. If nothing else, <em>Limbs</em> has made me look forward to where Radiohead takes us next. </p>

<h2 id="weightless-by-animals-as-leaders">Weightless by Animals as Leaders</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/animals-as-leaders-weightless.jpg" alt="Weightless by Animals as Leaders" /></p>

<p>Two eight-string guitarists and one insane drummer — it’s such an unusual lineup, and Animals as Leaders is an unusual band. Started as a bit of a side or solo project by lead guitarist Tosin Abasi, his debut album featured just one man and programmed drums, but it laid the groundwork for a technical metal act like no other. After recruiting some bandmates, Animals went on tour and proceeded to melt the faces of anyone who got close.</p>

<p><a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJQT-Y"><em>Weightless</em></a> takes the concepts explored on the debut — polyrhythms, syncopated percussion, quickly sweeping arpeggios — and multiplies everything by ten. Thousand. It’s heavier, more chaotic, and tighter than ever.</p>

<p>This is another band to see live. They somehow still have stage presence despite the lack of a proper frontman and vocals, and Abasi seems to take genuine pleasure in blowing minds with his music. Percussionist Navene Koperweis manages to keep up with both the twisted programmed beats of old and with his own work on <em>Weightless</em>. It is certainly a feat to play something that someone else wrote with a computer; it’s something else entirely to continue to write new material in the same style.</p>

<h2 id="burst-apart-by-the-antlers">Burst Apart by The Antlers</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/the-antlers-burst-apart.jpg" alt="Burst Apart by The Antlers" /></p>

<p>My immediate reaction to “I Don’t Want Love” was “this is a lighter direction for The Antlers than <em>Hospice</em>.” Peter Silberman’s lyrics weren’t much (or even any) happier, but the music was lighter, more melodic, and a little poppier. There’s more rock influence throughout this record than on <em>Hospice.</em> In fact, there’s more, period. Every song is meatier. While some may say that the sparseness of <em>Hospice</em> was one of its key elements, the full-bodied, well-crafted songs of <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUYlE"><em>Burst Apart</em></a> are even more essential to bringing The Antlers to life.</p>

<p>The main contributors to this full sound are Michael Lerner’s focused percussion and the addition of layered guitar work, provided live by Timothy Mislock. The riffs in Parentheses are a definite stand-out. Both on the stage and in the studio, one can see the passion behind the music. I’ve been lucky enough to catch The Antlers live a number of times, and each show is better than the last, with more energy than they could capture on the record. I’ve seen them on the intimate Parish stage, and I’ve seen them on the giant AMD stage at ACL. No matter the setting, these guys play their hearts out.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="father-son-holy-ghost-by-girls">Father, Son, Holy Ghost by Girls</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/girls-father-son-holy-ghost.jpg" alt="Father, Son, Holy Ghost by Girls" /></p>

<p>Once <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJRUZQ"><em>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</em></a> gets going (which is right away), Girls start rocking. There’s a bit of Spoon influence on the opening track, and a bit of Wilco throughout, but Girls manage to carve out their own rock niche here. “Die” really puts the pedal to the metal, and crowd-favorite “Vomit” has an incredibly catchy melody.</p>

<p>I admittedly know very little about Girls. I saw that they were recommended to me on Rdio, and I couldn’t stop listening to the album. I saw them live at Fun Fun Fun Fest, and they were amazing, but the record is where they really shine. It’s the sort of rock that doesn’t really stand out from the crowd too much until you realize that you’ve stopped doing whatever else it was you were doing while listening and your undivided attention is given to the music.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="little-hell-by-city-and-colour">Little Hell by City and Colour</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/city-and-colour-little-hell.jpg" alt="Little Hell by City and Colour" /></p>

<p>With the addition of percussion and backup guitars to nearly every song, Dallas Green has fleshed out his solo project to a full-fledged folk act. His lyrics are still tragic and romantic, but now they have more meat behind them.</p>

<p>I must have listened to <em>Bring Me Your Love</em> two hundred times. I haven’t listened to <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUrgI"><em>Little Hell</em></a> that much just yet, but I know I will. I can’t exactly pinpoint why, but this music is inherently re-playable. It never gets old. I usually chalk it up to Green’s incredible story-telling ability and pleasant accompaniment, but no matter how you try to explain it, this is great stuff.</p>

<p>Prepare to be saddened, but also prepare to leave what you’re doing and enter Green’s lyrical world.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="no-devolucin-by-thursday">No Devolución by Thursday</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/thursday-no-devolucion.jpg" alt="No Devolución by Thursday" title="No Devolución" /></p>

<p>Thursday turned a furious corner with 2006’s <em>A City by the Light Divided</em> and hasn’t looked back. <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJV4mU"><em>No Devolución</em></a> is the ultimate manifestation of the post rock-influenced dynamic that was only hinted at on their previous two efforts. There is an almost monstrous quality to some of the tracks on <em>No Devolución</em>: “Past and Future Ruins” is chaotic and grandiose all at once. The percussion through the entire album is forceful: the drums drive and the bass pulses. Ghastly yells are next to quiet, almost croaked vocals.</p>

<p>Geoff Rickly’s lyrics have always been somewhat enigmatic, and that is no different here. There are moments of poignancy — “I lost my wedding ring / down the kitchen sink” — but there are still some puzzlers — “There’s a thousand black cars / driving around in my blood stream.”</p>

<p><em>No Devolución</em> is Thursday’s magnum opus in a literal sense of the phrase. It is great, and it is the sum of all the passion that these guys have for music; a true work of the heart. It is sad that Thursday has <a href="http://thursday.net/thank-you">decided step down off of the stage</a>, but we can all be thankful for what they left us with.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="garden-window-by-obrother">Garden Window by O’Brother</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/garden-window-o-brother.jpg" alt="Garden Window by O'Brother" /></p>

<p>Huge. Everything about Garden Window is full, monolithic, and <em>epic</em>. I first heard O’Brother live in August at Emo’s inside. Even there on that puny stage, they had a wall-of-sound presence that couldn’t be ignored. I saw them a couple of months later at the new Emo’s East, and they were even tighter and bigger sounding. Needless to say, I was excited about the release of their LP, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJP-oU"><em>Garden Window</em></a>.</p>

<p>Every song on the album is meaningful — there is no filler. There are some lengthy songs here — crowd favorite “Poison!” clocks in at nearly eight minutes, and “Cleanse Me” is fourteen minutes long — but <em>Garden Window</em> never drags. Quite the opposite: each song is filled with so much building tension and dynamic that it feels like you’re going to explode with each listen. It’s hard to put O’Brother into a single category or genre, but it’s very heavy at its heaviest and it’s always unrelenting. This is post-rock for those who like their coffee strong and black.</p>

<p>I highly recommend seeing O’Brother live, in case that wasn’t obvious. They do a great job of capturing their sound on record, but it’s one thing to rock out to <em>Garden Window</em> with your headphones on at your desk and another thing entirely to hear the bass drone through a song with a cello bow while eye-bulging screams are heard over a wall of guitars and drums.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="majorminor-by-thrice">Major/Minor by Thrice</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/thrice-major-minor.jpg" alt="Major/Minor by Thrice" /></p>

<p>Thrice has delivered great musical experiences for over ten years. They have taken a curvy road to the release of <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJQWhk"><em>Major/Minor</em></a>, but it’s been an enjoyable journey every step of the way.</p>

<p><em>Major/Minor</em> is the most natural and expected follow-up to any album in Thrice’s discography. It builds on <em>Beggars’</em> grooviness but adds a lot more punch and poignancy. Every riff is carefully crafted, every beat brings you into the song. Every song is killer.</p>

<p>Thrice could not have <a href="http://www.thrice.net/post/13115093663/an-announcement-from-dustin">ended their musical career</a> on a higher note. The band could never put out any material that disappointed me, but I think this surpasses even harsh critics’ expectations. Let’s face it though: who’s a harsh critic of Thrice?</p>

<p>The first song I heard was the lead single and album opener, “Yellow Belly”. Its bluesy riff motif is echoed throughout the track, and right from the get-go we can feel that this is Thrice at their best. Other standout tracks include “Call It In The Air”, “Words In The Water”, and “Disarmed”, but there isn’t any filler here.</p>

<p>I was heartbroken to hear that Thrice was taking a break shortly after ending the tour that supported the release of <em>Major/Minor</em>. Thankfully I was able to see them live one last time. I know that every member of the band reached that decision after much contention. I’ve heard rumors that brothers Riley and Ed Breckenridge are working on something together, Dustin Kensrue remains the music worship leader at his church in Orange County, and I know that Teppei Teranishi cannot stay away from making music from long. I’m interested in hearing the direction that each of these guys go after being part of such a great band for so long.</p>

<hr />

<p>Like I said earlier, I picked out nineteen total albums this year. Here are the “honorable mentions,” so to speak, with a little bit about what I loved about them.</p>

<h4 id="mastodon---the-hunter">Mastodon - The Hunter</h4>

<p>Less “out-there” than <em>Crack the Skye</em>, it has some of the most poppy songs Mastodon has ever written, but all the face-melting is still there.</p>

<h4 id="man-man---life-fantastic">Man Man - Life Fantastic</h4>

<p>Incredible live act; the song writing just keeps getting better (and more sincere).</p>

<h4 id="neon-indian---era-extraa">Neon Indian - Era Extraña</h4>

<p>I only just found out about this band. It’s great music for chilling out or working to.</p>

<h4 id="fleet-foxes---helplessness-blues">Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues</h4>

<p>Vocal heaven. There are so many instruments and layers going on here. This is gorgeous, sleepy music.</p>

<h4 id="mister-heavenly---out-of-love">Mister Heavenly - Out of Love</h4>

<p>“Doom wop” is such a hilariously accurate term, and I can’t wait to hear more from these guys if they keep it going.</p>

<h4 id="august-burns-red---leveler">August Burns Red - Leveler</h4>

<p>These guys keep getting better and better. I don’t know how, but they outdid <em>Constellations</em> here. “Internal Cannon” is a standout track with its salsa breakdown — that’s not a typo.</p>

<h4 id="florence--the-machine---ceremonials">Florence + The Machine - Ceremonials</h4>

<p>A lot more serious this time around, but more heart and passion. I’d love to see this act live.</p>

<h4 id="childish-gambino---camp">Childish Gambino - Camp</h4>

<p>A lot of people dismiss Donald Glover as another actor-wannabe-rapper, but he’s got the chops. So many great beats and awesome, meaningful lyrics here.</p>

<h4 id="cloudkicker---let-yourself-be-huge">Cloudkicker - Let Yourself Be Huge</h4>

<p>It took a lot for me not to include this on my list of ten favorites. The closing track is amazing. The whole album is such a departure from other Cloudkicker material, and I’m curious to see where it goes next. Highly recommended.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lot of my picks centered around bands that I have also seen live this year. There’s something visceral about watching a band make music right in front of you. Whether you’re hearing a new act live for the first time or you’re enjoying live renditions of some of your old favorites, there’s something to be said for experiencing that beauty up close and personal.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my picks. Please let me know what you think and what your favorite music of 2011 is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I suck at writing, and I suck even more at writing often.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the list of my favorite music from 2009:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number four</em>: <strong>The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/between-the-buried-and-me_the-great-misdirect_2009.jpg" alt="The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me" /></p>

<p>Incredible work from the always-reliable technical metal group. This is an album for serious guitar and bass aficionados; the talent on display here is profound.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number three</em>: <strong>Crack The Skye by Mastodon</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/mastodon_crack-the-skye_2009.jpg" alt="Crack The Skye by Mastodon" /></p>

<p>A concept album about a paraplegic who gets involved with Russian ghosts told with typical Mastodon intensity, complete with a pretty awesome Rush tribute.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number two</em>: <strong>Beggars by Thrice</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/thrice_beggars_2009.jpg" alt="Beggars by Thrice" /></p>

<p>Probably my favorite band, Thrice turns yet another new page in the book of their ever-changing styles. Beggars is groovy and filled with Dustin Kensrue’s typical lyrical thoughtfulness.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number one</em>: <strong>Daisy by Brand New</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/brand-new_daisy_2009.jpg" alt="Daisy by Brand New" /></p>

<p>Brand New brings an intensity to a genre that (rightly) gets accused of being stale. Seeing these guys perform songs from both Daisy and Your Favorite Weapon live is an incredible sight.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.thomasupton.com/2010/05/the-year-in-music-e28093-number-five-i-and-love-and-you-by-the-avett-brothers"/>
    <updated>2010-05-15T15:06:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.thomasupton.com/2010/05/the-year-in-music-e28093-number-five-i-and-love-and-you-by-the-avett-brothers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-avett-brothers_i-and-love-and-you_2009.png" alt="I And Love And You by The Avett Brothers" /></p>

<p>I first heard <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/">The Avett Brothers</a> on a mix CD that a friend and I were listening to in the car. <em>Talk on Indolence</em> came on, and we both looked at each other in amazement. I begged him to find out from the friend who made the mix who these guys were and if they had any more music.</p>

<p>The Avett Brothers have come a long way since then. They have steadily become better musicians and singers, and they have reached a certain level of mainstream fame (cf. their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3H5BhWQij8">appearance on Letterman</a>.) <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The%2520Avett%2520Brothers/I%2520And%2520Love%2520And%2520You">I And Love And You</a></em> represents both a pinnacle of achievement for the North Carolina trio and an indication that they are not quite finished sharing their music with the world.</p>

<p>One thing that is immediately noticeable is a focus on richer songs filled with more and varied instruments than before. The piano is featured fairly heavily. The production of this album is excellent; each song feels full and finished, which is not something that one usually thought of when listening to previous efforts. One other thing to note is the prominence of drums in most of the songs: this is somewhat unusual for a band that does not have a permanent drummer. The trio take turns drumming when they play live, and it works very well.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/_/I+And+Love+And+You">I And Love And You</a></em> is a great opening track, full of dynamic and great piano playing. The track perfectly encompasses the whirlwind rise that the band has experienced over the past year or so. <em>The Perfect Space</em> is another lush piano track, with a great transition to a pop-piano-rock feel in the second half of the song.</p>

<p>A track that showcases the drums that I mentioned above is the aptly-named <em>Kick Drum Heart</em>. Very catchy, very poppy, and very good.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tracks on the album is <em>Slight Figure Of Speech</em>. It evokes the jangley pop of the sixties while still managing to sound fresh. I was lucky enough to hear a live version of this track in Austin last October, and it sounded great.</p>
