[Donnie Darko](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/) is an amazing film.  I didn't find out about it until December 2004, three years after it orignially hit US theatres, and I am ashamed for it.

On the surface it seems to be a teenage story of a confused kid and his visions.  A second and third viewing reveal this movie to be much more.  Although it comes across as a rather pretentious film, the symbolism and imagery are just too vivid to ignore.  A quick (or involved) visit to the [web site](http://www.donniedarko.com/) gives you an inkling of what this film entails.

I'm not going to post a plot summary here; you have to go out and watch this film yourself.  Do yourself a favor and watch the original first, followed by the [Director's Cut](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006GAOBI/qid=1112589613/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-4190662-4857520?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846) a day or two later.

"Donnie Darko?  What the hell kind of name is that?  It's like you're some sort of superhero or something."

"What makes you think I'm not?"
