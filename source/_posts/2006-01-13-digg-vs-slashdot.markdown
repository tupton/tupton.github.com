[Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org/) just posted a [meaty article](http://www.kottke.org/06/01/digg-vs-slashdot) comparing the traffic boosts from both [Digg.com](http://www.digg.com/) and [Slashdot.org](http://slashdot.org/) after an [article of his](http://www.kottke.org/plus/50-ways-ipod/) was posted on both sites.

It's an interesting read for sure, and I especially like the fact that the link was actually months old despite the fact that it was posted as a "new" story on both sites.  It's also interesting to me that I subscribed to [kottke.org](http://www.kottke.org/) a day before the Slashdot posting, for reasons totally unrelated to the iPod article.
