Lost may very well be the best thing on television.  24 is the only competition, and I'm happy to watch both.  I'm just sad that they are both over.

The season finale for Lost was the most convoluted, breathtaking, confusing, awesome, amazing, and interesting end to a season that I have ever seen.  Granted, I'm not a big TV buff, but I know what I like, and I like Lost.

I can't wait until next season.  I'm not going to discuss the show out of respect for those that haven't seen it, but suffice it to say that now is the perfect time to catch up with both seasons and get prepared (pumped!) for next season.
