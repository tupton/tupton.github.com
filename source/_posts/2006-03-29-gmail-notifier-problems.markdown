**UPDATE:** It looks like the Gmail Notifier has been fixed.  Who knows what went wrong?  I'm just glad that it's fixed.



I thought it might have been just me, but [Hawk Wings](http://www.hawkwings.net/) says that [some people are reporting issues](http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/03/29/gmail-notifier-problems/) with the latest version of Google's [Gmail Notifier](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/notifier/index.html).

I'm too busy with school work right now to try and see what's up with the app, but it seems that the Notifier gets messages very late, and, even after displaying a [Growl notification](http://wafflesoftware.net/gmailgrowl/), doesn't register new mail in the Inbox.

[Gmail Status](http://www.uebercoders.net/gms/) seems to be working fine for now, despite a notice on the developer's homepage about the latest version always displaying zero unread mails even when there is mail in the Inbox.

Come on Google! First you [delete your blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/and-were-back.html), then you go and mess up the Notifier?  What's going on?!
