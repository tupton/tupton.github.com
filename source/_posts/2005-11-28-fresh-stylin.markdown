My site now has a brand spanking new style, courtesy of [Blogger Templates](blogger-templates.blogspot.com/).  I added a new navigation menu to the top of all my pages.  This includes links to my internal pages as well as my "social pages" such as [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/third/), [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/third/), and [Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/TUpton/).  My most recent bookmarks and pictures are on the [front page](/thomas/), and you can check out [new music](/thomas/music.html) that I have added in the past month, too.  I'm going to try to update it every month; eventually I should get around to automating the task daily.




I hope the new template is enjoyable!
