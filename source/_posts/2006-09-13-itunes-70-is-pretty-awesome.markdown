I love the new UI of [iTunes 7.0](http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/).

The new features can be found all over the internet, but I read most of the details at [The Unofficial Apple Weblog](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/09/12/walkthrough-itunes-7s-big-new-features/).

One of the features that I noticed today is that the iTunes Store now provides three simultaneous downloads.  Along with creating a Currently Downloading playlist in your Source List on the left side of the window, three items can be downloaded concurrently.  It's the little things, Apple.
