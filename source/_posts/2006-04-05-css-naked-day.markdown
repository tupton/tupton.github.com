While [the concept](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/) is nice, I really hate going to everyone's blog and not being able to see these wonderful designs that everyone is so proud of.

Over at [Stylegala](http://www.stylegala.com/news/public200604/1617.htm) there is an interesting comment thread about this idea.  Sure, the underlying XHTML is very important.  I even disabled my stylesheets in Firefox and fixed a couple errors in my markup that I wasn't happy with. One could argue that this is the point of CSS Naked Day, but I don't see the point in shoving it in every user's face.

I can't wait for 6th April, the CSS Renaissance.
