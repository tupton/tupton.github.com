This past Monday, Yahoo announced the purchase of desktop widget application [Konfabulator](http://konfabulator.com/).  With the purchase came the announcement that Konfabulator would be free, and anyone who bought version 2.0 or later would be eligible for a refund of the application's former $20 charge.

I like Konfabulator _almost_ better than Dashboard.  Dashboard seems to have [more](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/sysstat.html) [useful](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html) [widgets](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/music/symphonic.html), while Konfabulator seems to have more ["just for fun"](http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=36689) widgets.

However, Konfabulator offers cross-platform ubiquity and, with the involvment of Yahoo, an open API for developers to make the most of this potential content delivery system.

My solution?  Use both!  With [1.25 GB of RAM](http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/06/more-ram.html), I have the specs to handle it, and the 20" Cinema Display definitely offers the screen real estate.  I only run a few widgets in each application, and it's not too taxing on my system.

The picture frame widget now integrates [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) photos, and the weather widget provides a link to Yahoo weather and gets its weather information from the [Weather Channel](http://www.weather.com/index.html), which is marginally better than [AccuWeather](http://home.accuweather.com/index.asp?partner=accuweather) (I prefer [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) for accuracy.)

With the availability of the same widgets on both Windows and OS X and the involvement of a new Yahoo dev community, Konfabulator could be well on its way to becoming a new means of grabbing the information that you want, whether it's from your system or from a feed of your favorite site.

This all leads me to wonder:  What will Google's answer be?
