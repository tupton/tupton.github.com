In light of some [recent][jw-tools] [excellent][cd-tools] posts about tools that smart people use, here are my essential tools that I used in 2011.

## Hardware

I use a 15" MacBook Pro i5 with 8 GB of RAM. It's quick and does everything I need it to. It's not *too* bulky, but it's certainly bigger than my older 13" MacBook. I keep toying with the idea of a MacBook Air, but I can't justify the cost and I don't want to use two machines.

I connect to an Apple LED Cinema Display when I'm at my standing desk, and I use a [Logitech wireless keyboard][logitech-kb] and an Apple Magic Trackpad.

I do [daily, local backups][local-backup] to a smallish volume on a 1 TB hard drive. The rest of the drive holds my music, photos, and other media.

## Software

I do all of my work (both professionally and on this site) on VMs in "the cloud" that I `ssh` to with [iTerm 2][iterm2]. I love that it can copy-on-select and the customizable colors are more robust than in other terminal apps. I used the built in Terminal.app for a long time, but the latest iTerm 2 is stable and excellent.

I also use [HTTP Client][http-client] to test our API, as well as both Firefox and Chrome.

[http-client]: http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/

When I write code, I usually use [`vim`][vim], but I've been testing out the recent alpha builds of [TextMate 2][tm2].

When I write for this website or for my own personal notes, I've started using [Byword][byword] to write and preview Markdown. Its fullscreen and "paragraph focus" modes are nice touches. I've heard good things about [Marked][marked], which allows Markdown previews from any app, but I haven't used it yet.

I'm not a huge calendar user, but I do keep track of [shows I attend][lastfm-events] and personal events on Google Calendar. I interact with my calendars with [Fantastical][fantastical]. Its natural language event input is pretty great and lets me add events really quickly.

I work on and use a browser-based email client at work, but I also like to use [Sparrow][sparrow]. The minimal interface stays out of the way, but all my mail is available quickly. Shortcuts for reply and reply all make it easy to respond to threads. A nice little touch: Sparrow automatically picked up the fact that I had an IMAP folder called Archive in my work email and started using it when I press Delete to archive messages.

I use [Alfred][alfred] all day every day. My usage statistics say I average 13.6 uses per day, but if you didn't count weekends, holidays, or days that I don't actually use my computer, I bet it'd be a lot higher. I *love* the clipboard management.

I occasionally use [Cloud][cloud] to quickly upload screenshots, but I don't use it for much else.

I use [Dropbox][dropbox] to manage files, share some music with friends, and back up certain documents. I also store my (encrypted) [1Password][onepass] data on Dropbox so that I can access my passwords from anywhere.

[Divvy][divvy] and [Stay][stay] are two window management tools that I use all the time. When I disconnect from my display, Stay puts my windows back to where I want them. It doesn't quite work with Chrome, but everything else works well. Divvy lets me resize windows on a custom-sized grid. You can even define shortcuts â€“ I use "c" for a centered window and "6" for a window taking up 60% of the right side of the screen.

I recently started using [Evernote][evernote], but I haven't gotten into it just yet. I'll have more to write about that when learn how to use it and actually start using it more. I do use [Evernote's Clearly][evernote-clearly] browser extension to read articles on line.

For my musical pleasure throughout the day, I still use iTunes a lot of the time. However, [Rdio][rdio] (with [Airfoil][airfoil]) is usually how I listen to music these days. Airfoil makes it easy to listen to music in my living room via my Apple TV.
