[Apple](http://www.apple.com/) continues to boggle my mind.



	
  * [iWork '05](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) - The second rendition of Keynote, plus a stylish new word processor called Pages.  Only Apple could make the thought of typing documents enticing.

	
  * [iLife '05](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) - All new updates to the iLife suite.  The calendar display in iPhoto and the new Garageband look especially amazing.

	
  * [iPod Shuffle](http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/) - Apple wants us to rock out blindly and in no particular order, but at that price, I don't really care if they want us to [march off of a cliff](http://lemmings.deinonych.com/).

	
  * [Mac Mini](http://www.apple.com/macmini/) - Six and a half inches square, two inches high, and a million gajillion tons of awesomeness.  Wow.


I guess you could say that this year's [Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/) was fairly successful.  [Steve Jobs](http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html) might have [crashed his demo of Spotlight](http://stream.apple.akadns.net/), but 2005 is definitely the year of the Apple.
