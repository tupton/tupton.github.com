Holy canoodles, how is [this for weird](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/15/103358/720)?

Monophasic sleep, which is how most people sleep, is divided into [five stages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#A_Clinical_Analysis_-_Stages_of_Sleep).  [Polyphasic sleep](http://www.here-be-dreams.com/sleep/polyphasic.html) causes the brain to bypass the first 4 - 4 1/2 stages and instead slip almost immediately into a short stage of [NREM](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=non-rapid%20eye%20movement), followed by a lengthened stage of [REM](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=rapid%20eye%20movement).

The thing is, one only sleeps about two to three hours every 24 hours (six 20 - 30 minute naps a day, which is a nap every four hours.)  Even with this reduced total amount of sleep, total REM increases.

Read the [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) for more information and this [Everything2 article](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542) for a few firsthand accounts from people who have converted.  This [blog](http://polyphasic.blogspot.com/) is solely dedicated to polyphasic sleep.

I think I like sleeping too much to try it, but it is definitely intriguing.
