The Stop Online Piracy Act (explanation via [Kottke][kottke] on [what's wrong with SOPA][sopa-wrong]) is bad for the internet in general. [GoDaddy supports SOPA][godaddy-sopa-support], and this has alarmed many of its customers, including this [Redditor with fifty one domains][reddit-godaddy] and myself.

Again via Kottke, I came across [this guide to moving from GoDaddy to NameCheap][guide-to-namecheap] ([Google cache][cache-guide]). [NameCheap][namecheap] has officially come out against SOPA, and their site and experience has been nothing but top notch since I started the transfer process.

I've also heard good things about [Hover][hover]; by all means shop around for a registrar that fits your needs and doesn't blatantly support SOPA.

My transfer process to NameCheap is nearly complete, and I couldn't be happier to leave GoDaddy. Don't forget that December 29th is Move Your Domain Day!
