It seems to me that there has been some [negative](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/waiting-for-new-powerbooks-again) response to Apple's care of its customers recently.  With all the [new](http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html) [products](http://www.apple.com/imac/) from Apple, perhaps they are neglecting the very people that make the demand for these products?  Codswallop.

About two weeks ago, my iPod slipped out of hand, from about a foot high onto tile.  It was wearing its wasabi iSkin at the time, and it merely reset itself afterwards.  I thought nothing of it, until about two days later.  The buttons stopped responding, and the critical battery icon would flash intermittently.  Two Thursdays ago, I requested a service order from Apple.  The next day, DHL delivered an empty box, wanting to take my iPod right then and there.  Unfortunately, I was not home, and I had to take it to DHL on Monday.

Last Thursday, a brand new iPod was waiting for me when I got home.  I could not believe my eyes.  Apple had taken my iPod, ordered a new unit, and sent it back to me, all within a less-than-a-week turnaround.  Unbelievable!

Thank you, Apple.
