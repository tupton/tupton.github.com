Over the past few days, I have been making the transition to [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) for my blogging fix.  I've heard some great things about the open-source software, and I wanted to see for myself whether or not I could make the switch.  My [hosting company](http://lunarpages.com/) doesn't really put a limit on MySQL databases, so I had a few handy.  Installation was a breeze; the [five-minute installation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install) took about four minutes, download included.

By far the hardest part of the transition was the theme.  I found a [basic theme](http://www.visual-assault.org/wpTheme_basic/) that just contained the core of the necessary template, and edited from there.  I put all those files into a separate directory and added [my theme](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bluetop-v11.zip)[](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/bluetop-v1.0.zip) to Wordpress so that I could keep the basic theme for the future.

Some of the typography is slightly different, and I have no idea why, but the header and the sidebar are mostly the same.  I'm going to be adding some new features in the near future, and Wordpress should make that a whole lot easier.
