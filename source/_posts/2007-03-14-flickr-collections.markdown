[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) just [announced](http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2007/03/today_we_launch.html) a new feature set for organizing photos:  [collections](http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/collections/).  Collections are sets of sets or even other collections, up to five levels deep.  This has been a long requested feature, and I'm glad to see that Flickr has finally added this functionality to their great photo organizing app.
