I recently installed [Lessn][lessn] and then [Lessn More][lessnmore] to take control of my own short links. Lessn is a very simple URL shortener that is hosted on my own domain.

I registered [upton.in][uptonin] to serve my short links. I chose the ".in" TLD because it's short and common. I do wish there was an ".on" TLD so I could register *upt.on*, but I like the connotation of "in". As [I said on Twitter the other day][uptonin-twitter], it can mean "Internet, inside, come in, infinity, interesting" among other things.

Lessn also integrates nicely with [Mint][mint], which I recently started using. I plan to write more on that shortly.
