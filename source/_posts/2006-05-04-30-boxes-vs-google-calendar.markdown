I've been using [30 Boxes](http://30boxes.com/) for a while now, but I was intrigued at the release of [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/).  The support for GCal in the developer community seems to be much greater than any of the other web-based calendars, which makes sense given Google's prolific presence in the online world.

I made a post a little while ago that [described some of my initial impressions of GCal](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=78); this post is going to focus on what elements of Google Calendar 30 Boxes needs in order to form an Ã¼bercalendar.



## Third Party Support



Within GCal's short lifetime, it has already given life to a [Firefox extension](http://torrez.us/archives/2006/04/18/433/) and a Quicksilver plugin (check your QS prefs to grab it.)  While 30 Boxes seems to have [support for developers](http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/developers/), there have not been many results to speak of.  The [Themes section](http://30boxes.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&sid=1a52a1befee97860c1a9cbb832bb458a) of their website is sorely lacking, and a quick [Google search for Firefox extensions](http://www.google.com/search?q=30%20boxes%20firefox%20extension) turns up completely irelevant results.

I want some third party support for 30 Boxes.  It's an amazing app, but it could definitely benefit from outside help.



## Access Keys



Pressing a modifier in order to activate access keys is so 2005.  I love zipping around Gmail and GCal with just a few presses of the keyboard.  Maybe someone could write a Greasemonkey script for this, but the keys need to be default to the app itself.



## Calendar Views



GCal's Agenda view is pretty nifty, and 30B needs a week and proper day view that is accessible from the main page.  Just having the month view can get pretty stale after a while.  In fact, the 30B interface could stand to take a few lessons from Google.  Sure, GCal is a bit cluttered, but the settings page is way more efficient than the 30B version.



## ... And Vice Versa



And now that I have lambasted 30B, here are some awesome things that Google needs to implement:



#### Tags



This could be the factor that determines whether or not I switch over to GCal.  Google, multiple calendars is cool and all, but we need tags.  Now.



#### RSS Feeds / Overlays



This is one of my favorite parts of 30B.  I love seeing bookmarks and photos from buddies.



#### Social Aspects



30B was built to be a social app from the beginning, and it shows.  The way that buddy calendars overlay onto your own calendar is ingenious.  I haven't done much with the sharing on GCal, but I know that event invites and additions in 30B is a breeze.

I know that 30B is actively working on implementing new features (and by actively, I mean, can someone tell the 30B guys to get a test server?  This night testing beta feature thing is driving me insane!), and I'm sure that Google is, too.  We as end users can only benefit.
