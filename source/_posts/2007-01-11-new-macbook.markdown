![New MacBook](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/new_macbook.JPG)

I got a new [MacBook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html) last week, and it is FAST.  From start-up, to login, to opening apps, to using apps, it is blindingly, blisteringly fast.  I'm very excited about my new purchase.

It's a black, 2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook with 2 GB RAM and 120 GB HDD.

Here is a [Flickr set of the unpacking photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/sets/72157594474124489/).

Unfortunately, there's an issue with the sound output when external speakers are plugged in.  I [posted on the discussion boards about my issue](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=803432&tstart=0), but I don't seem to have much of a response.  I'm going to call Apple when I get back to school over the weekend and see what I can do about a replacement.  I have a dead pixel on the screen, too, right out of the box, and that's just plain old annoying.
Other than that, this machine is great!  I suppose I'll have to start looking for a new use / home for my Powerbook G4 now.
