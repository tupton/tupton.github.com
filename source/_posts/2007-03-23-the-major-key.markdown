[Patrick Wolf](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Wolf/+wiki)'s latest album [The Magic Position](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Position-Patrick-Wolf/dp/B000LRY9WM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-1563552-9943909?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1174626280&sr=8-1) is super-catchy eighties-throwback clap-along fun! Every time I hear the [title track](http://www.last.fm/music/Patrick+Wolf/_/Magic+Position), I smile.  The [video is great, too](http://youtube.com/watch?v=HeR9_7cACUc), especially when he does his little double step at the beginning of the chorus.  I think Wikipedia [hit it on the head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Wolf) with their folktronica classification.
