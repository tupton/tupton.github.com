Holy #$*&!

[What an awesome move, Apple](http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/).

I can only imagine what this does for Apple's image, both in the home and in the corporate world.

From the Boot Camp page:


> More and more people are buying and loving Macs. To make this choice simply irresistible, Apple will include technology in the next major release of Mac OS X, Leopard, that lets you install and run the Windows XP operating system on your Mac. Called Boot Camp (for now), you can download a public beta today.


Now I really want a MacBook Pro.
