In light of my [previous post](http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/01/music.html), you can find an HTML version of my iTunes Library (created with [iTunes XHTML Playlist](http://spark.is-a-geek.net/itunesxhtmlplaylist/)) on my [band's website](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/tsg).  We haven't played since July 2004, but I am ever hopeful that we can still play music together.



**UPDATE:** The domain is no longer active.  Plus, maintaining a 7000+ song library of music in an HTML page was not fun.
