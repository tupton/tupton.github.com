I have added a [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) "[thingy](http://theory.isthereason.com/?p=499)" that posts my daily [del.icio.us links](http://del.icio.us/third) to my blog.  I have been trying to add a pithy description to each of my links so as to explain them in a little more detail than is possible with just the page name.  Enjoy.
