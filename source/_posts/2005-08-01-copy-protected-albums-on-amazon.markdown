[![Amazon Copy Protected CD](http://photos21.flickr.com/30397480_278be540ec_o.png)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00079018K/qid=1122928108/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-6181845-7529664?v=glance&s=music&n=507846)

This may be old news, but Amazon seems to indicate which albums it sells are copy protected.  I haven't looked to see if any other albums are flagged like this, but it seems that "Copy Protected CD" is one of the formats that is listed on
[Amazon's Buying Guide](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature-pop-up/-/570000/ref=cd_format_pop/002-6181845-7529664).  When was this implemented, and do they catch all copy protected media?  Has anyone bought an seemingly normal album from Amazon only to find that it was copy protected?

Even though this indication is nice, a copy protected work is not [technically a CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc#Copy_protection), but I think Amazon labeled it as such to reduce confusion.
