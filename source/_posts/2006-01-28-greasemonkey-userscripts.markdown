**Update:** These scripts no longer work. Both websites have since refreshed their user interface.



I have made available two [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) userscripts that I have authored.  They are both based on the [del.icio.us Prettifier](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/geek-to-live/geek-to-live-my-favorite-greasemonkey-user-scripts-143499.php), written by [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/) editor Gina Trapani.

The [del.icio.us Prettifier](http://www.fiveuptons.com/thomas/gm/deliciousprettifier.user.js) (right-click to install if you have Greasemonkey) changes the font, font size, and numerous link colors.  The  bookmarks themselves are highlighted much better than the default style.

The [Last.fm Prettifier](http://www.fiveuptons.com/thomas/gm/lastfmprettifier.user.js) (right-click to install Greasemonkey) makes chart links utilize the entire width of the chart, and highlight in Audioscrobbler red on hover.

Enjoy!
