I bought and watched [A History Of Violence](http://imdb.com/title/tt0399146/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9YSBoaXN0b3J5IG9mIHZpb2xlbmNlfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1) this evening, and I was reminded that I have seen some amazing films recently.

I saw [Syriana](http://imdb.com/title/tt0365737/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9c3lyaWFuYXxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=23)  over winter break, and, while I had to see it twice to really get it, I enjoyed the film.  When I saw a post on [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/) about [Running Scared](http://imdb.com/title/tt0404390/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9cnVubmluZyBzY2FyZWR8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1), I was immediately enthralled.  I saw it opening night with my dad, and we both thought that while it was over the top, it was still a good film.

After watching the Oscars (something I haven't done for two or three years,) I realized that I was missing some great films.  I rented and loved [Crash](http://imdb.com/title/tt0375679/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9Y3Jhc2h8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=206;fm=1) so much that I watched it twice.  I also really enjoyed watching [Walk The Line](http://imdb.com/title/tt0358273/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9d2FsayB0aGUgbGluZXxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1) with my wonderful girlfriend over Spring Break, and consequently started listening to a lot more Johnny Cash!Â  I borrowed [The Constant Gardener](http://imdb.com/title/tt0387131/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9dGhlIGNvbnN0YW50IGdhcmRlbmVyfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=16) from my parents, and I loved that.  Like Syriana, I may have to watch it again to fully comprehend it, but I thought it was amazingly well done.  I also recently saw [Paradise Now](http://imdb.com/title/tt0445620/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9cGFyYWRpc2Ugbm93fGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1) and [A Very Long Engagement](http://imdb.com/title/tt0344510/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9QSBWZXJ5IExvbmcgRW5nYWdlbWVudHxmdD0xfG14PTIwfGxtPTUwMHxjbz0xfGh0bWw9MXxubT0x;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1) at the independent theatre [The Lyric](http://www.thelyric.com/) in Blacksburg, and I loved them both.

Along with A History Of Violence, which I thought was amazing, I also bought [Good Night, And Good Luck](http://imdb.com/title/tt0433383/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9Z29vZCBuaWdodCBhbmQgZ29vZCBsdWNrfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=21).  I have high expectations.
