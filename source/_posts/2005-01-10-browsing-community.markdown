If you know much about me, you know that I am big supporter of OSS and the people who develop it.  [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) is a prime example of a community that has built around the common goal of creating a great product for the good of the public. In this case, the amazing browser built by the fine folks at [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/about/) has taken the simple idea of browsing the web and (re)turned it into an easy, user-friendly experience, making us reminisce about times when "spyware" was not yet a household word.  The community that has built as a result of Mozilla's [choice](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) [software](http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/) [offerings](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/) is simply astounding.  Just one look at [Planet Mozilla's](http://planet.mozilla.org/) blog amalgamation RSS feed unveils a team of hardworking men and women who volunteer their time and effort in order to make the internet a little bit more forgiving.

Why can't [more companies](http://www.microsoft.com/) be like that?

If you're still using IE, do yourself a favor.  [Get Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com/).
