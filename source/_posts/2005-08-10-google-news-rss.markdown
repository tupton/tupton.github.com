Google [announced yesterday](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/breaking-story-google-news-feeds.html) the immediate availability of RSS feeds for their news page.  You can subscribe to any section of news that is available at [http://news.google.com](http://news.google.com).  I am still wondering why they did not make sure the feeds show up in Firefox via the Live Bookmark icon, but I use [Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/) anyway.
