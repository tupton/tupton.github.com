Tonight will be the one week milestone in my quest to learn the [Dvorak keyboard layout](http://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/).  I am slowly but steadily becoming more comfortable, and therefore faster, with it, but I still have yet to even come close to rivalling my Qwerty typing speeds.  Like I said [before](http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/01/dvorak-day-6.html), it takes two weeks to learn.  I start [school](http://www.vt.edu/) next week, so it is naturally my goal to be proficient by then.

Here are some things that I noticed:



	
  * I can type "that" really quickly.

	
  * "N" and "T" seem to switch places on a regular basis.

	
  * I always forget where the "R" is.

	
  * For the longest time, I was not able to reach the "I" comfortably.



I never learned to touch-type, which is both a good and a bad thing.  Good in that I don't have the Qwerty touch method so ingrained in my mind; bad in that I didn't really know where to start placing my fingers at first.  However, the hand placement has started to become second nature, obviously a good sign that I am on the right track.

I'll update the Dvorak progress in another few days.  It isn't exactly heartstopping news, and I can assure everyone that my life is a little more exciting than the fact that my comma key is now where the "W" was.  And vice versa.  I bet you didn't notice that, did you?  I'd bet even more that I know how much you care.
