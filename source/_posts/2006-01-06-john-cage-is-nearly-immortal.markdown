Yesterday, the second chord change of [the longest concert EVER](http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/magazine/articles/2012/john_cage_organ_project_halberstadt) occurred.

[Serene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage).

_UPDATE 2016-06-14_: I changed the broken link that was previously in this post to a more recent one that works and has a bit more history about ASLSP. Shout out to [Dmitry at Artsy][artsy] who found this post recently and informed me about [Arty's John Cage page][jca]. Check it out if you're interested in learning more about Cage and his music.
