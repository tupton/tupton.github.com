I changed my blog layout to the [Hemingway theme] [hemingway] and directed Wordpress to publish to the root of my section of [FiveUptons.com] [five uptons].
    
[hemingway]: http://warpspire.com/hemingway
[five uptons]: http://fiveuptons.com

I am now using Wordpress plugins to display [my del.icio.us bookmarks] [delicious], [Last.fm tracks] [last.fm], and [Flickr photos] [flickr].

[delicious]: http://rick.jinlabs.com/code/delicious/
[last.fm]: http://rick.jinlabs.com/code/lastfm/
[flickr]: http://eightface.com/wordpress/flickrrss/

To all three of my readers out there, please let me know if there are any issues with the new layout and presentation.
