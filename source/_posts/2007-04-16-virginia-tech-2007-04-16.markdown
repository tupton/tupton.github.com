The reasons behind today's incidents will almost certainly never be known.

What will be known and remembered is that Virginia Tech's students, faculty, and staff are now forever changed.  Let today's events serve as an explicit reminder of the tragedy that is able to be wreaked upon us, but also let us stand strong, let us never forget the fallen, and let us show our Hokie Pride through all we do, forever and ever.
