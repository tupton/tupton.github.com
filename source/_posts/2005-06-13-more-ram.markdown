I bought [1GB of RAM](http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16820155111) from [newegg.com](http://newegg.com) the other day, and the results it gives me are absolutely amazing.  My Powerbook is so zippy and snappy that I'll have to watch my fingers before they get caught.

Ok, sorry!  But I am excited!  From 512MB to 1.25GB is quite a leap, and I can definitely see an improvement.
