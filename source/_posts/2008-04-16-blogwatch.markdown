A couple of my friends have blogs, too.

* [Jason Emerick] [jason] is currently working on an [RTM] [] [app for the Blackberry] [app], and has some interesting ideas for future projects. He also likes hockey.
* [Ben Hilburn] [ben] finally got himself a domain and [has started a blog] [blog]. Keep a look out for some Linux love and some anecdote about him ploughing your girlfriend last night.
