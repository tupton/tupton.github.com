[iTunes 4.9 was released](http://apple.com/itunes/download/) this morning.  Something rather interesting that I noticed, however, was the [lack of the 30 GB iPod](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa) in the online store.  The 30 GB iPod Photo is still advertised on the [main iTunes page](http://apple.com/itunes/), meaning that this happened only very recently. Could this mean that new iPods are set to come out today?!



**UPDATE:**  I guess not.  The 20 GB iPod now has a color screen, and there are only two full size iPods available.  Cool, but where are the 20, 40, and 80 GB iPods?
