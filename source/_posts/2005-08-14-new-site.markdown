I have moved my blog to [a new site](http://fiveuptons.com/thomas/blog/).  I'm not sure how long Blogger keeps URLs that are no longer published to, but [http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/](http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/) will remain up as long as possible.  Please change your bookmarks and feed readers accordingly.
