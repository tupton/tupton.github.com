Mapquest?  What is that?

[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) is a new tool from [Google](http://google.com/) that does just what you think it's supposed to do: it gives you maps of pretty much anywhere in America.  The really neat part is that you can drag the map, zoom in and out, and view waypoints on the map without having to reload the map every time you change something.

They have a few examples on the page itself, but you really should try it out.  For example, I searched [Blacksburg, Va](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=blacksburg%2C%20va&spn=0.114502%2C0.233818), for [Chinese food](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=chinese&spn=0.057251%2C0.116909&sll=37.229444%2C-80.414167&sspn=0.114502%2C0.233818), and, lo and behold, we have even more Asian food possibilities than even I knew about here in the old 'Burg.  A search for [free wifi](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=free%20wifi&ll=37.289063%2C-80.416550&spn=0.916016%2C1.870546&sll=37.229444%2C-80.414167&sspn=0.114502%2C0.233818) yields similar results.

[Driving directions](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=ny%2C%20ny%20to%20la%2C%20ca) are intense!  Try clicking the number next to each step of the directions.  Amazing!

Google continues to be a paragon of software and business awesomeness.
