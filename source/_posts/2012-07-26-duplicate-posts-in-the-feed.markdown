When I first switched over to Octopress, the feed for this site was completely new. The last
twenty or so posts showed up as new again, and it was kind of annoying.

I realized yesterday that my site was still configured to be hosted on [tupton.github.com][ghp], so
I switched it to [blog.thomasupton.com][blog]. This must have reset the site's feed again, causing
recent posts to show up as unread.

[ghp]: http://tupton.github.com
[blog]: http://blog.thomasupton.com

This should hopefully be the last time that happens, and hopefully it wasn't too hard to mark all
posts from this site as read. I apologize for any inconvenience.
