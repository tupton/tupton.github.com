[![Last.fm Scrobbles Geography](http://static.flickr.com/85/247080089_3b595645f8.jpg)](http://static.last.fm/vis/scrobbles.gif)

[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) developer [Russ](http://www.last.fm/user/Russ/) posted [a neat image on his journal](http://www.last.fm/user/Russ/journal/2006/09/13/226806/).  This kind of visualization is so cool to look at, and reveals a lot about the service.  It's a 24 hour look at scrobbles from around the world.  Great stuff, Russ.
