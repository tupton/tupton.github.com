[Last.fm](http://last.fm/user/tupton/) is a site that keeps track of all the songs that you play, in a media player of your choice.  It's a pretty neat site for personal use, but I wanted to put some information about my recently played tracks on my [main page](http://fiveuptons.com/thomas).  I found [this page](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/wiki/index.php/RecentlyPlayedImageV2) on the [Audioscrobbler wiki](http://www.audioscrobbler.net/wiki/), which is a great help.  You can see the results on my [main page](http://fiveuptons.com/thomas).  Eventually I want to modify the script to output HTML that I can style myself, but I do not know a lick of PHP and I wouldn't know where to start.
