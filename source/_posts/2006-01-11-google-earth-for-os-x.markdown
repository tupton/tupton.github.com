Google has finally released an [OS X version of the superb Google Earth application](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/google-earth-in-mac-world-pc-too.html).  This makes a grand total of [two applications](http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/index?promo=gdl-en) that Google has made for the Mac OS.

I'm not at home to test it out, but it looks pretty neat from the [screenshot](http://earth.google.com/images/macscreenshot.jpg).

This is cool, even amongst all the other [recent crazy Apple news](http://macworld.apple.com.edgesuite.net/mw/index.html). Yeah, you'll hear more about that later.
