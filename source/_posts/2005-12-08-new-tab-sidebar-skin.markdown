[![Firefox, Tab Sidebar, GrApple Theme](http://static.flickr.com/34/72348883_9a2d4d0801.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/72348883/)

The amazing [Tab Sidebar](http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/tabsidebar/index.html) Firefox extension was recently updated, breaking my [earlier Mac OS X UI improvements](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/?p=43).  I've updated the images that are needed; simply replace (but don't forget to save!) the original images in the extension folder, [as explained previously](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/?p=43).

[Here are the new files](http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/tab_sidebar_mac_widgets.zip).  They are based on the [GrApple Firefox Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=Top%20Rated&numpg=10&id=642); if anyone knows of any restrictions on these images, then please let me know.
