So I'm a little late on posting this news, but Apple has changed the initial behavior of the [iTunes MiniStore](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303066) to better convey what the new feature does.

While the MiniStore still transmits to Omniture, this change to an opt-in feature makes all the difference in the world.  Thank you, Apple.

A quick response and the right thing... All from a "greedy" corporation.
