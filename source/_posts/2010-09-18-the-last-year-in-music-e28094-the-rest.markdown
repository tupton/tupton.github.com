I suck at writing, and I suck even more at writing often.

Here's the rest of the list of my favorite music from 2009:

* *Number four*: **The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me**

Incredible work from the always-reliable technical metal group. This is an album for serious guitar and bass aficionados; the talent on display here is profound.

* *Number three*: **Crack The Skye by Mastodon**

A concept album about a paraplegic who gets involved with Russian ghosts told with typical Mastodon intensity, complete with a pretty awesome Rush tribute.

*  *Number two*: **Beggars by Thrice**

Probably my favorite band, Thrice turns yet another new page in the book of their ever-changing styles. Beggars is groovy and filled with Dustin Kensrue's typical lyrical thoughtfulness.

* *Number one*: **Daisy by Brand New**

Brand New brings an intensity to a genre that (rightly) gets accused of being stale. Seeing these guys perform songs from both Daisy and Your Favorite Weapon live is an incredible sight.
