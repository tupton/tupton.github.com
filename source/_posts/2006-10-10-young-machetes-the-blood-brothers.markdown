[![Young Machetes - The Blood Brothers](http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/blood_brothers-young_machetes-2006.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Young-Machetes-Blood-Brothers/dp/B000ICLRKM/sr=1-1/qid=1160531140/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0333363-6217517?ie=UTF8&s=music)



I was first introduced to [The Blood Brothers](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blood+Brothers) almost two years ago.  A friend from down the hall recommended _[...Burn Piano Island, Burn](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blood+Brothers/...Burn%2C+Piano+Island%2C+Burn)_, and I instantly loved Johnny Whitney's tortured screams and the ridiculously over-the-top nature of their music.  Synthesizers and electric guitars, go!

I sought out _[Crimes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blood+Brothers/Crimes)_ soon after listening to _Burn_, and I loved it.  It has earned a top ten album spot from me  almost immediately.  The Brothers' pop-infused trash-can-bashing ridiculorock is so unqiue in today's scene, and it stands out like a peacock with crooked feathers.

_[Young Machetes](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Blood+Brothers/Young+Machetes)_ opens up with a murderously catchy hook, and then sets off a wall of noise that floods your ears relentlessly.  Morgan Henderson's heartbeat of a bassline rumbles throughout Set Fire To The Face On Fire, and continues on through the rest of the album.  There is plenty of the facemelting hardcore instrumentalism that purists remember from _Burn_, but the boys have added just the right amount of the very same pop-from-hell that made _Crimes_ that much better.  Standout tracks include _Spit Shine Your Black Clouds_, where poppy synths and choral hooks fail to disguise a sad and disturbing story that spouts from Jordan Blilie's and Whitney's lips; _Vital Beach_, which is possibly heavier than anything from _Burn_ or even the Blood Brothers' earlier releases; and _Street Wars / Exotic Foxholes_, a dischordant anthem with an ambient outro that leaves you questioning the past five minutes' happenings.  From the decaying riffs of _We Ride Skeletal Lightning_ to the chillingly truthful outro of _Lift The Veil, Kiss The Tank_ (Death's just death no matter how you dress it up! Oh oh oh, oh oh oh!); from Whitney's uncomfortably out-of-place piano / vocal solo in the middle of _Camouflage, Camouflage_ to the raging anti-war / anti-materialistic chorus of _Huge Gold AK-47_, and finally to the amazingly complex and disturbing closer, _The Giant Swan_, Machetes delivers what any red blooded Brother could expect from a new album.

Rating: 4.5/5
