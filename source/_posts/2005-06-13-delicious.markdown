I am a little late to the scene with this one, but to be honest, I had no idea what [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) was.  I did not understand the premise of the service, and I did not (at first) see what benefits it offered.

I must have been blind.

del.icio.us is a social bookmarking community.  Buzzwords aside, del.icio.us lets one post bookmarks to a web page that anyone can access.  The site keeps track of [how many people bookmark a certain site](http://del.icio.us/url/e47d06a59309774edab56813438bd3ce) and [how popular sites are](http://del.icio.us/popular/) based on how many recent bookmarkings particular sites have had.

The feature that really makes investing is del.icio.us worthwhile is tagging.  One may add as many tags to a link as he wants.  For instance, if I bookmarked this site I would tag it with "blog" and perhaps even "apple."  [Since I started using the service](http://del.icio.us/third) last week, I have about one hundred bookmarks and hundreds more tags.

del.icio.us can be used for countless different things, most of which make your life a lot easier.

At work, I'll see an item I might want to buy while browsing, but I won't have the time to look into it.  Instead of gmailing myself with a new bookmarks file, I just click a little snippet of javascript in my Bookmarks Bar and the link is ready on my site for when I get home later that evening.

Instead of searching Google for Firefox keyboard shortcuts, I just typed "[http://del.icio.us/tags/firefox+keyboard/](http://del.icio.us/tags/firefox+keyboard/)" and found exactly what I was [looking for](http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard).
