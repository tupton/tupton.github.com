Inspired by [Jason Kottke] [Kottke cities], a list of the cities I visited in 2008.

* Columbia, MD
* Madrid, Spain
* Vera, Spain
* Seville, Spain
* Granada, Spain
* Frederick, MD
* Fall's Church, VA
* Harrogate, England
* Kitty Hawk, NC
* Brick, NJ
* Oak Ridge, NC
* Blacksburg, VA

I spent one or more nights in each of these cities. I went to [Spain for spring break] [Spain photos], and visited family in England over the summer. I stayed at a friend's house in Columbia before the Spain trip and in Frederick after. I saw [Kate Nash in Washington, DC] [Kate Nash] and stayed with a friend in Fall's Church, after which I visited a friend in Brick just for fun. My family and I went on a vacation to the beach in Kitty Hawk. My family lives in Oak Ridge, and I live in Blacksburg.
