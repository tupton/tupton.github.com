After not posting all summer, I am trying to get some more posts written and posted as soon as possible.  I am going to a [presentation and Q&A;](http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2006/08/blacksburg_va_t.html) with [Pandora.com](http://pandora.com/) founder Tim Westergren tonight; hopefully a post will follow.

I am taking 18 credit hours this semester, but so far I like all my classes, and the workload does not seem like it will become overbearing.  More downtime equals more posting time, so be happy.
Stay tuned for more posts in the near future...
