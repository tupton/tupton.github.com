Santa brought me [The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword][skyward-sword] for Christmas (thanks Mom!). I've enjoyed playing it, just as I've enjoyed playing video games for nearly my entire life.

In recent years, however, I've abandoned or not fully played all of my video games. I attempted to maintain a Google Docs spreadsheet to keep track of my unplayed games, but it quickly became more neglected than the games themselves.

I recently found out about Shaun Inman's [*Unplayed*][unplayed], and it seemed perfect. It's like a much simpler, lightweight Shelfari for video games. You can now see which games I'm playing (or not playing) at my [*Unplayed* page][my-unplayed]. For now, I'm going back to Skyloft!
