  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suck at writing, and I suck even more at writing often.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the list of my favorite music from 2009:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number four</em>: <strong>The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/between-the-buried-and-me_the-great-misdirect_2009.jpg" alt="The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me" /></p>

<p>Incredible work from the always-reliable technical metal group. This is an album for serious guitar and bass aficionados; the talent on display here is profound.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number three</em>: <strong>Crack The Skye by Mastodon</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/mastodon_crack-the-skye_2009.jpg" alt="Crack The Skye by Mastodon" /></p>

<p>A concept album about a paraplegic who gets involved with Russian ghosts told with typical Mastodon intensity, complete with a pretty awesome Rush tribute.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number two</em>: <strong>Beggars by Thrice</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/thrice_beggars_2009.jpg" alt="Beggars by Thrice" /></p>

<p>Probably my favorite band, Thrice turns yet another new page in the book of their ever-changing styles. Beggars is groovy and filled with Dustin Kensrue’s typical lyrical thoughtfulness.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number one</em>: <strong>Daisy by Brand New</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/brand-new_daisy_2009.jpg" alt="Daisy by Brand New" /></p>

<p>Brand New brings an intensity to a genre that (rightly) gets accused of being stale. Seeing these guys perform songs from both Daisy and Your Favorite Weapon live is an incredible sight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-avett-brothers_i-and-love-and-you_2009.png" alt="I And Love And You by The Avett Brothers" /></p>

<p>I first heard <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/">The Avett Brothers</a> on a mix CD that a friend and I were listening to in the car. <em>Talk on Indolence</em> came on, and we both looked at each other in amazement. I begged him to find out from the friend who made the mix who these guys were and if they had any more music.</p>

<p>The Avett Brothers have come a long way since then. They have steadily become better musicians and singers, and they have reached a certain level of mainstream fame (cf. their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3H5BhWQij8">appearance on Letterman</a>.) <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The%2520Avett%2520Brothers/I%2520And%2520Love%2520And%2520You">I And Love And You</a></em> represents both a pinnacle of achievement for the North Carolina trio and an indication that they are not quite finished sharing their music with the world.</p>

<p>One thing that is immediately noticeable is a focus on richer songs filled with more and varied instruments than before. The piano is featured fairly heavily. The production of this album is excellent; each song feels full and finished, which is not something that one usually thought of when listening to previous efforts. One other thing to note is the prominence of drums in most of the songs: this is somewhat unusual for a band that does not have a permanent drummer. The trio take turns drumming when they play live, and it works very well.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/_/I+And+Love+And+You">I And Love And You</a></em> is a great opening track, full of dynamic and great piano playing. The track perfectly encompasses the whirlwind rise that the band has experienced over the past year or so. <em>The Perfect Space</em> is another lush piano track, with a great transition to a pop-piano-rock feel in the second half of the song.</p>

<p>A track that showcases the drums that I mentioned above is the aptly-named <em>Kick Drum Heart</em>. Very catchy, very poppy, and very good.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tracks on the album is <em>Slight Figure Of Speech</em>. It evokes the jangley pop of the sixties while still managing to sound fresh. I was lucky enough to hear a live version of this track in Austin last October, and it sounded great.</p>

<p>It’s incredible, but I had never heard of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/dredg">Dredg</a> before this album. I was seriously missing out, but I am so glad that I found this album. Inspired by Salman Rushdie’s <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/oct/16/salmanrushdie">Imagine There Is No Heaven: A Letter To The Six Billionth Citizen</a></em>, the album is an eclectic mix of experimental and art rock. Every song brings something to the table, but the entire album is marked by impeccable production and great musicianship.</p>

<p>A large number of tracks comprise the album; some shorter instrumentals and breaks intersperse longer, more traditional songs. <em>Drunk Slide</em> is the first of these, and even though it’s less than ninety seconds long, it is still a worthy listen. <em>Ireland</em>, the track that immediately follows, is one of the highlights of the album. It’s one of those tracks that makes you want to sing along, even if you don’t know the words. That quickly becomes a theme of the record.</p>

<p>There are so many eclectic styles of music on this record that it’s hard to sum it up. The album is definitely meant to be listened to as a whole, but that doesn’t mean that each song doesn’t stand on its own. Take <em>Mourning This Morning</em>, for instance. The peppy palm-muted guitar that plays throughout the song almost makes you want to dance. The preceding track, <em>I Don’t Know</em> is a poppy little rock groove, and a couple tracks later comes <em>Long Days And Vague Clues</em>, a song that could be straight out of a seventies spy flick.</p>

<p><em>Pariah</em> certainly requires the listener’s attention, but it is well worth every moment.</p>

<p>Dredg dedicated the album to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Deftones">Deftones</a> bassist Chi Cheng, who was left in a coma after a horrific car accident in November 2008.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/converge_axe-to-fall_2009.jpg" alt="Axe To Fall by Converge" /></p>

<p>No one ever said that <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Converge">Converge</a></em> wasn’t intense, but <em>Axe To Fall</em> hits you right in the face from the very first measure. If opener <em>Dark Horse</em> is a frantic mashing together of everywhere you expected <em>Converge</em> to evolve to, the next track throws all that away. <em>Reap What You Sow</em> still maintains that manic pace, but throws in synths and an absolutely ridiculous guitar solo. Like, straight out of Kirk Hammet’s curly locks guitar solo. If you aren’t out of breath by the time you’ve finished listening to the first two tracks, then you didn’t listen closely enough. I’m not sure that <em>Converge</em> could play this album live from start to finish because I’m not sure any human beings could keep up such a relentless onslaught.</p>

<p>The title track brings back some of that chaotic Converge riffage that we all remember from <em>Jane Doe</em>, but then <em>Effigy</em> shoves even more synthy goodness down your throat.</p>

<p><em>Axe</em> is evidence that Converge is evolving, and their direction could not be more pointed. They have obviously always been talented musicians, but it’s almost like it took this long for the band to realize that they could showcase their diversity and musical maturity with no fear.</p>

<p>The most remarkable parts of this album come at the end. The final two tracks are such a radical departure from the chaos of the rest of the album. <em>Cruel Bloom</em> is almost a sort of weird Tom Waits tribute, if Tom Waits were in to haunting your nightmares. The slow pace is a change, but you can still feel the intensity that the band projects. I’m not sure if that’s because of the residue from the rest of the album, but this song certainly stands on its own.</p>

<p>Closer <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YojThNUSpkw">Wretched World</a></em> is a work of art. I know that a lot of Converge fans won’t want to hear this one at a show, but no one can deny the emotion that this song evokes. A lot of Jacob Bannon’s lyrics come from a heartbroken point of view, but this song manages to wrap some of the saddest lyrics in such beautiful music. I would love to hear more from this side of Converge.</p>

<p>When it’s over, <em>Axe To Fall</em> is Converge’s strongest effort to date. I don’t think they’ll be playing on your local radio station any time soon, but this album is strong enough to please fans of old while perhaps opening some new eyes to this quartet’s music.</p>

<p>I have a bone to pick with <em>Portugal. The Man</em>. The <a href="http://www.vinylcollective.com/2009/08/06/po-portugal-the-man-the-satanic-satanist-lp-german-import/">European LP</a> comes packaged in a beautiful and intricate piece of folded and cut cardboard. The <a href="http://portugaltheman.merchnow.com/products/104165">US version</a> is just a gatefold. I pre-ordered <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Portugal.+The+Man/The+Satanic+Satanist">The Satanic Satanist</a></em> on vinyl in support of the band, and now I wish I had the “cool version.” Fortunately, the packaging of an album has no bearing on the quality of the music inside. (But seriously, I covet that artwork.)</p>

<p><em>Satanist</em> is one of those pop rock albums that goes just far enough into left field to pique your interest with every song but stays mainstream enough to make it a hit at any party you host. I was singing along with this album before I even knew the words. The Beatles influences abound here, but where that might be an insult to some (or even many) bands, Portugal. The Man knows how to use their idols for inspiration and not for source material.</p>

<p><em>Lovers in Love</em> remains my favorite track on <em>Satanist</em> even though there are ten other contenders for the top spot on this eleven track album. Something about John Gourley’s falsetto and the fast-paced wah-guitar and bongos of the chorus just really hits me in the right way. The entire album has this groove to it that mandates that you listen to it as a whole. The cohesion of the songwriting and the musicianship is uncanny. I made mention of the “singability” of this album earlier, but I must repeat it again because it’s so important. You’ll be singing along to <em>Lovers</em>, <em>Everyone is Golden</em>, and <em>The Home</em> before you’ve finished listening to those songs for the first time. I think that’s a sign of a band that really understands the art of songwriting, and these guys certainly aren’t afraid to show off their talent.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming, but I think <em>Portugal. The Man</em> is about to become something big. The quintet has already recorded a follow-up to <em>Satanist</em> to be released this coming spring, but this album already goes a long way towards convincing the world that punctuation <em>in medias res</em> is cool again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/horse-the-band_desperate-living_2009.jpg" alt="Desperate Living by HORSE the Band" /></p>

<p>It might be considered rash to place an album that you have been listening to for less than two weeks in your top ten list of best albums of the year, but I don’t think choosing <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/HORSE+the+band/Desperate+Living">Desperate Living</a></em> as my number nine album is a decision I’ll regret. HORSE the Band is certainly not a mainstream band (their chiptune beats and hardcore tendencies mixed with Nathan Winneke’s bizarre lyrics is not a combination that everyone can get into), but this is great music with a huge sense of originality.</p>

<p>The first track I heard from <em>Desperate Living</em> was <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF_v7ek5o-s">Shapeshift</a></em>. What starts out as a moody and ethereal track soon crashes into blast beats and screams, which soon transforms into this sort of alt-rock breakdown, which is then interrupted by what can only be described as the soundtrack to a Game Boy game from 1993. It only gets weirder from here, and this is only one track! <em>Xiu Xiu</em> frontman Jamie Stewart makes an angelic contribution to the song’s outro, which is somewhat unusual for a <em>HORSE</em> track.</p>

<p>The album is filled with pitch-shifted tones that remind you of the warped soundtracks from bad VHS transfers and some of the most intricate guitar and drum work out there. If that’s not a mind-bender, I don’t know what is. Here’s the thing: it all sounds amazing. Every single track keeps you on your toes and gets you to alter all of your expectations. I must have listened to this album more than ten times already, and I hear something new every time.</p>

<p><em>Desperate Living</em> is certainly a step forward for <em>HORSE the Band</em> in terms of sound and songwriting, but there is still that familiar “Nintendo-core” vibe and wacky humor that longtime fans have come to expect. Take the end of of the title track for instance: The words “I’m a plumber, but what I plumb is the fruit of infinity. I’m deeper than infinity, so infinite, I look infinity look like a four” are spoken with no explanation whatsoever. And there’s that bit about dinosaurs in the aforementioned <em>Shapeshift</em>. And the nearly-comical synth breakdowns on <em>The Failure of All Things</em>. And they fact that they named a song after themselves. And the album’s cover artwork.</p>

<p><em>My Girls</em> is an incredible song. You should stop reading this review and go <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zol2MJf6XNE">watch the video right now</a>. Make sure it’s in HD.</p>

<p>Animal Collective is less of a band and more of a, well, collective. The lineup shifts regularly, and every album is a new adventure. <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective">Merriweather Post Pavillion</a></em> is, however, the group’s crowning achievement. Their eighth studio album contains some of the most accessible and focused songs they have written, but still maintains that familiar (if “familiar” is even a term that can be used to describe their sound) neo-psychedelic pop rock that we have come to love over the past few years.</p>

<p>The airy intro of <em>In the Flowers</em> gives way to hand claps and bouncy beats and serves as the perfect intro to the aforementioned <em>My Girls</em>. Every song on the album has a distinct feel to it yet still manages to sound just like an Animal Collective album should. It’s interesting that I would be reviewing this album now, almost exactly one year since I first listened to it. Its uplifting melodies and beats stand in stark contrast to the dark and cold nights that I associate with listening to the album. This is a summer album, through and through. It should be listened to in a car with no top or while lying on a blanket in a green field. Case in point: <em>Summertime Clothes</em>. I dare you not to start bopping your head to this song.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the album, we are all invited to slow down on the track <em>No More Runnin</em>. This easy-going lullaby quickly gives way to one of the quirkiest and poppiest tracks on the album. Closer <em>Brother Sport</em> will have you humming the melody for days and even weeks after the song has stopped playing.</p>

<p><em>Merriweather</em> is some of Animal Collective’s best produced and most cohesive work to date, and all that extra effort definitely pays off. Just be careful that you don’t spend too long staring at that mesmerizing album art.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part two of my list of great albums that didn’t quite make my top ten list continues. You can find <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2009/12/the-year-in-music-%e2%80%94-honorable-mentions/">part one here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/fever-ray_fever-ray_2009.jpg" alt="Fever Ray by Fever Ray" /></p>

<h3 id="fever-ray-by-fever-rayhttpwwwlastfmmusicfeverrayfeverray"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fever+Ray/Fever+Ray">Fever Ray by Fever Ray</a></h3>

<p>Karin Dreijer Andersson has a prolific musical history. She has collaborated on numerous tracks by fellow Scandinavians Röyksopp, and The Knife’s <em>Heartbeats</em> has been covered numerous times. Her debut solo album doesn’t stray too far from the pitch-shifted multi-tonal vocals that give The Knife such a distinctive sound; <em>Fever Ray</em> is marked by sparse beats and deep lyrics.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/florence-+the-machine_lungs_2009.jpg" alt="Lungs by Florence + The Machine" /></p>

<h3 id="lungs-by-florence--the-machinehttpwwwlastfmmusicflorence2b252b2bthe2bmachinelungs"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Florence%2B%252B%2BThe%2BMachine/Lungs">Lungs by Florence + The Machine</a></h3>

<p>This is pop music, through and through. But it’s well-written, uplifting, and magical pop music. Florence Welch has an imposing voice, and she uses it to great effect. <em>Kiss with a Fist</em>, the first single, is a spunky tune about a couple that are a little too close, but it’s not even the strong point of the album. Opener <em>Dog Days are Over</em> just makes you want to sing along until your neighbors yell at you, and if <em>Drumming</em> doesn’t get your toes tapping, there’s something amiss.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/bat-for-lashes_two-suns_2009.jpg" alt="Two Suns by Bat for Lashes" /></p>

<h3 id="two-suns-by-bat-for-lasheshttpwwwlastfmmusicbatforlashestwosuns"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/Two+Suns">Two Suns by Bat for Lashes</a></h3>

<p>Natasha Khan has one of those voices that makes you stop and really listen. At once airy and prominent, the songwriting on <em>Two Suns</em> complements her voice perfectly. Leadoff single <em>Daniel</em> has been playing nearly every day since I found out about this album. I only recently found out about Bat for Lashes, but I am already hooked.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/fuck-buttons_tarot-sport_2009.jpg" alt="Tarot Sport by Fuck Buttons" /></p>

<h3 id="tarot-sport-by-fuck-buttonshttpwwwlastfmmusicfuckbuttons"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fuck+Buttons">Tarot Sport by Fuck Buttons</a></h3>

<p><em>Tarot Sport</em> is the perfect album to listen to while you’re doing something else. That’s not an insult to the album; on the contrary, the droning noise rock and minimalist beats make this a favorite programming album. There’s more substance to the songs on <em>Tarot Sport</em> than on their previous album <em>Street Horrrsing</em>, but I’ll leave it to you to decide whether that makes this band more mainstream.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/gallows_grey-britain_2009.jpg" alt="Grey Britain by Gallows" /></p>

<h3 id="grey-britain-by-gallowshttpwwwlastfmmusicgallows"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gallows">Grey Britain by Gallows</a></h3>

<p>Gallows is bringing back good old punk rock, and they don’t care if you want it or not. Vocalist Frank Turner spits and sneers at you through every one of the brutal tracks on this album. Even the acoustic act one of <em>The Vulture</em> gets you pumped for the inevitable: Gallows knows how to rock. This is a band I’d love to see live.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-number-twelve-looks-like-you_worse-than-alone_2009.jpg" alt="Worse Than Alone by The Number Twelve Looks Like You" /></p>

<h3 id="worse-than-alone-by-the-number-twelve-looks-like-youhttpwwwlastfmmusicthenumbertwelvelookslikeyouworsethanalone"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Number+Twelve+Looks+Like+You/Worse+Than+Alone">Worse Than Alone by The Number Twelve Looks Like You</a></h3>

<p>The Number Twelve Looks Like You seems to be one of the most overlooked bands in recent memory. I never hear anyone talk about them, yet they have outdone themselves musically album after album, and they continue to be a group whose releases I really look forward to. Unfortunately, the band broke up in November. The most technical of mathcore dominates <em>Worse Than Alone</em>, with time signature shifts, key changes, and varying tempos galore, this album requires your full attention. What a parting gift for their fans.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/them-crooked-vultures_them-crooked-vultures_2009.jpg" alt="The Crooked Vultures by Them Crooked Vultures" /></p>

<h3 id="them-crooked-vultures-by-them-crooked-vultureshttpwwwlastfmmusicthemcrookedvulturesthemcrookedvultures"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Them+Crooked+Vultures/Them+Crooked+Vultures">Them Crooked Vultures by Them Crooked Vultures</a></h3>

<p>I had the immense pleasure to see Mssrs. Homme, Grohl, and Jones in Austin, TX at the Austin City Limits music festival in October. No one knew any of their songs, but everyone knew that they were listening to something special. And who should expect anything less from this trio? The pounding tempo change at the end of <em>No One Loves Me And Neither Do I</em> leaves you in awe, and, if for no other reason, see them live for the intro to <em>Elephants</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7744-the-top-50-albums-of-2009/">outstanding</a> <a href="http://www.spin.com/gallery/40-best-albums-2009">end-of-year</a> top album lists have been out there for a few weeks. I took it upon myself to come up with a list of my favorite music of the past year. 2009 was such a great year for music, and it was tough for me to come up with a list of just ten albums to share. </p>

<p>There were many great releases that didn’t make my own cut, and I want to highlight them here. Here’s part one of my list.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/john-frusciante_the-empyrean_2009.jpg" alt="The Empyrean by John Frusciante" /></p>

<h3 id="the-empyrean-by-john-frusciantehttpwwwlastfmmusicjohnfrusciante"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Frusciante">The Empyrean by John Frusciante</a></h3>

<p>I knew I had hit come upon something special from the moment I heard its nine minute opener, <em>Before the Beginning</em>, but it was Frusciante’s cover of Tim Buckley’s <em>Song to the Siren</em> that made me fall in love with <em>The Empyrean</em>. Other highlights include the cheesy synthesized drums, groovy bassline, and ooh-ing chorus line of <em>Dark/Light</em> and Frusciate’s warbled but earnest vocals on <em>Enough of Me</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-antlers_hospice_2009.jpg" alt="Hospice by The Antlers" /></p>

<h3 id="hospice-by-the-antlershttpwwwlastfmmusictheantlershospice"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Antlers/Hospice">Hospice by The Antlers</a></h3>

<p>I haven’t had a chance to listen to any of Peter Silberman’s solo work (also released under the name The Antlers), but if the full-band concept album <em>Hospice</em> is any indication, I need to get right on that. This album contains some of the saddest lyrics that I have ever heard, but, paired with some excellent song-writing, that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/august-burns-red_constellations_2009.jpg" alt="Constellations by August Burns Red" /></p>

<h3 id="constellations-by-august-burns-redhttpwwwlastfmmusicaugustburnsredconstellations"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/Constellations">Constellations by August Burns Red</a></h3>

<p>Matt Greiner’s drumming skills are the first thing that strike you when opener <em>Thirty and Seven</em> first pounds through your head. Of course, every member of this band is a talented musician, as showcased on such standout tracks as <em>Ocean of Apathy</em> and <em>Meddler</em>. I must have listened to this album a thousand times while on my way to work over the summer, and it got me pumped every single day.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-dear-hunter_life-and-death_2009.jpg" alt="Act III: Life and Death by The Dear Hunter" /></p>

<h3 id="act-iii-life-and-death-by-the-dear-hunterhttpwwwlastfmmusicthedearhunter"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dear+Hunter">Act III: Life and Death by The Dear Hunter</a></h3>

<p>Part three of a continuing saga, <em>Life and Death</em> sees The Dear Hunter’s mixture of baroque pop and progressive rock flesh out into something even more grandiose than the previous two chapters. I only found out about Casey Crescenzo’s project a few weeks before the release of this album, but I quickly caught up on Acts I and II. This album has such an epic feeling, and that’s something that they bring to their live show, too. When I saw them in Raleigh, they opened with a rendition of <em>Writing on a Wall</em> that was indistinguishable from the album version, and later had The Fall of Troy vocalist and guitarist Thomas Erak join them for <em>Red Hands</em> (a track from Act II).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-fall-of-troy_in-the-unlikely-event_2009.jpg" alt="In the Unlikely Event by The Fall of Troy" /></p>

<h3 id="in-the-unlikely-event-by-the-fall-of-troyhttpwwwlastfmmusicthefalloftroyintheunlikelyevent"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall+of+Troy/In+the+Unlikely+Event">In the Unlikely Event by The Fall of Troy</a></h3>

<p>The Fall of Troy have one of the most intense and insane live shows around. Vocalist and guitarist Thomas Erak seems to enter his own world on stage, and you can’t help but be sucked into it. <em>In the Unlikely Event</em> does a pretty good job of capturing that energy. There are few more sections of clean vocals on this album than on previous efforts, and one can certainly detect an overall effort to broaden the group’s musical horizons. <em>Panic Attack!</em> and slower-than-usual <em>Webs</em> are two favorites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recorded my <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thrice/_/Red+Sky">fifty thousandth scrobble</a> to Last.fm at the beginning of this past August. I recently found <a href="http://kastuvas.us.to/lastfm/">a site that can generate the dates</a> on which you reached certain “milestones” in your scrobbling history. Since I have a rather large data set, I thought it would be neat to visualize my listening over the past four years.</p>

<p>This first image is a graph of the number of days it took me to listen to one thousand tracks. Looking at the chart, I can tell that I have been taking longer to listen to the same amount of music, but I have no idea why. It also seems that I have recently started going through phases of listening to a relatively large amount of music and then stopping, rinsing, and repeating. </p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2560/4048331825_bd657807bb_o.png" alt="Last.fm Milestones — Differences" /></p>

<p>The next image just corroborates what the other chart implicated: I don’t listen to music as much as I used to. It shows a graph of the moving average of the number of days it takes me to listen to my next one thousand tracks. I bet that a graph that charts when and how much music is added to my iTunes library would both match up with these charts and show a significant slowdown over the past few months and years.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2437/4049077916_109ae05991_o.png" alt="Last.fm Milestones — Average" /></p>

<p>There are fifty one milestones in these charts represented by forty five different artists. Four different artists appear more than once. There are no individual songs that appear more than once. My <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/charts?rangetype=overall&subtype;=artists">top three overall artists</a> appear on the list, as do five of my top ten.</p>
