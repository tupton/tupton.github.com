  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/horse-the-band_desperate-living_2009.jpg" alt="Desperate Living by HORSE the Band" /></p>

<p>It might be considered rash to place an album that you have been listening to for less than two weeks in your top ten list of best albums of the year, but I don’t think choosing <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/HORSE+the+band/Desperate+Living">Desperate Living</a></em> as my number nine album is a decision I’ll regret. HORSE the Band is certainly not a mainstream band (their chiptune beats and hardcore tendencies mixed with Nathan Winneke’s bizarre lyrics is not a combination that everyone can get into), but this is great music with a huge sense of originality.</p>

<p>The first track I heard from <em>Desperate Living</em> was <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF_v7ek5o-s">Shapeshift</a></em>. What starts out as a moody and ethereal track soon crashes into blast beats and screams, which soon transforms into this sort of alt-rock breakdown, which is then interrupted by what can only be described as the soundtrack to a Game Boy game from 1993. It only gets weirder from here, and this is only one track! <em>Xiu Xiu</em> frontman Jamie Stewart makes an angelic contribution to the song’s outro, which is somewhat unusual for a <em>HORSE</em> track.</p>

<p>The album is filled with pitch-shifted tones that remind you of the warped soundtracks from bad VHS transfers and some of the most intricate guitar and drum work out there. If that’s not a mind-bender, I don’t know what is. Here’s the thing: it all sounds amazing. Every single track keeps you on your toes and gets you to alter all of your expectations. I must have listened to this album more than ten times already, and I hear something new every time.</p>

<p><em>Desperate Living</em> is certainly a step forward for <em>HORSE the Band</em> in terms of sound and songwriting, but there is still that familiar “Nintendo-core” vibe and wacky humor that longtime fans have come to expect. Take the end of of the title track for instance: The words “I’m a plumber, but what I plumb is the fruit of infinity. I’m deeper than infinity, so infinite, I look infinity look like a four” are spoken with no explanation whatsoever. And there’s that bit about dinosaurs in the aforementioned <em>Shapeshift</em>. And the nearly-comical synth breakdowns on <em>The Failure of All Things</em>. And they fact that they named a song after themselves. And the album’s cover artwork.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/animal-collective_merriweather-post-pavillion_2009.jpg" alt="Merriweather Post Pavillion by Animal Collective" /></p>

<p><em>My Girls</em> is an incredible song. You should stop reading this review and go <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zol2MJf6XNE">watch the video right now</a>. Make sure it’s in HD.</p>

<p>Animal Collective is less of a band and more of a, well, collective. The lineup shifts regularly, and every album is a new adventure. <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective">Merriweather Post Pavillion</a></em> is, however, the group’s crowning achievement. Their eighth studio album contains some of the most accessible and focused songs they have written, but still maintains that familiar (if “familiar” is even a term that can be used to describe their sound) neo-psychedelic pop rock that we have come to love over the past few years.</p>

<p>The airy intro of <em>In the Flowers</em> gives way to hand claps and bouncy beats and serves as the perfect intro to the aforementioned <em>My Girls</em>. Every song on the album has a distinct feel to it yet still manages to sound just like an Animal Collective album should. It’s interesting that I would be reviewing this album now, almost exactly one year since I first listened to it. Its uplifting melodies and beats stand in stark contrast to the dark and cold nights that I associate with listening to the album. This is a summer album, through and through. It should be listened to in a car with no top or while lying on a blanket in a green field. Case in point: <em>Summertime Clothes</em>. I dare you not to start bopping your head to this song.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the album, we are all invited to slow down on the track <em>No More Runnin</em>. This easy-going lullaby quickly gives way to one of the quirkiest and poppiest tracks on the album. Closer <em>Brother Sport</em> will have you humming the melody for days and even weeks after the song has stopped playing.</p>

<p><em>Merriweather</em> is some of Animal Collective’s best produced and most cohesive work to date, and all that extra effort definitely pays off. Just be careful that you don’t spend too long staring at that mesmerizing album art.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part two of my list of great albums that didn’t quite make my top ten list continues. You can find <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2009/12/the-year-in-music-%e2%80%94-honorable-mentions/">part one here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/fever-ray_fever-ray_2009.jpg" alt="Fever Ray by Fever Ray" /></p>

<h3 id="fever-ray-by-fever-rayhttpwwwlastfmmusicfeverrayfeverray"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fever+Ray/Fever+Ray">Fever Ray by Fever Ray</a></h3>

<p>Karin Dreijer Andersson has a prolific musical history. She has collaborated on numerous tracks by fellow Scandinavians Röyksopp, and The Knife’s <em>Heartbeats</em> has been covered numerous times. Her debut solo album doesn’t stray too far from the pitch-shifted multi-tonal vocals that give The Knife such a distinctive sound; <em>Fever Ray</em> is marked by sparse beats and deep lyrics.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/florence-+the-machine_lungs_2009.jpg" alt="Lungs by Florence + The Machine" /></p>

<h3 id="lungs-by-florence--the-machinehttpwwwlastfmmusicflorence2b252b2bthe2bmachinelungs"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Florence%2B%252B%2BThe%2BMachine/Lungs">Lungs by Florence + The Machine</a></h3>

<p>This is pop music, through and through. But it’s well-written, uplifting, and magical pop music. Florence Welch has an imposing voice, and she uses it to great effect. <em>Kiss with a Fist</em>, the first single, is a spunky tune about a couple that are a little too close, but it’s not even the strong point of the album. Opener <em>Dog Days are Over</em> just makes you want to sing along until your neighbors yell at you, and if <em>Drumming</em> doesn’t get your toes tapping, there’s something amiss.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/bat-for-lashes_two-suns_2009.jpg" alt="Two Suns by Bat for Lashes" /></p>

<h3 id="two-suns-by-bat-for-lasheshttpwwwlastfmmusicbatforlashestwosuns"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bat+for+Lashes/Two+Suns">Two Suns by Bat for Lashes</a></h3>

<p>Natasha Khan has one of those voices that makes you stop and really listen. At once airy and prominent, the songwriting on <em>Two Suns</em> complements her voice perfectly. Leadoff single <em>Daniel</em> has been playing nearly every day since I found out about this album. I only recently found out about Bat for Lashes, but I am already hooked.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/fuck-buttons_tarot-sport_2009.jpg" alt="Tarot Sport by Fuck Buttons" /></p>

<h3 id="tarot-sport-by-fuck-buttonshttpwwwlastfmmusicfuckbuttons"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fuck+Buttons">Tarot Sport by Fuck Buttons</a></h3>

<p><em>Tarot Sport</em> is the perfect album to listen to while you’re doing something else. That’s not an insult to the album; on the contrary, the droning noise rock and minimalist beats make this a favorite programming album. There’s more substance to the songs on <em>Tarot Sport</em> than on their previous album <em>Street Horrrsing</em>, but I’ll leave it to you to decide whether that makes this band more mainstream.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/gallows_grey-britain_2009.jpg" alt="Grey Britain by Gallows" /></p>

<h3 id="grey-britain-by-gallowshttpwwwlastfmmusicgallows"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gallows">Grey Britain by Gallows</a></h3>

<p>Gallows is bringing back good old punk rock, and they don’t care if you want it or not. Vocalist Frank Turner spits and sneers at you through every one of the brutal tracks on this album. Even the acoustic act one of <em>The Vulture</em> gets you pumped for the inevitable: Gallows knows how to rock. This is a band I’d love to see live.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-number-twelve-looks-like-you_worse-than-alone_2009.jpg" alt="Worse Than Alone by The Number Twelve Looks Like You" /></p>

<h3 id="worse-than-alone-by-the-number-twelve-looks-like-youhttpwwwlastfmmusicthenumbertwelvelookslikeyouworsethanalone"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Number+Twelve+Looks+Like+You/Worse+Than+Alone">Worse Than Alone by The Number Twelve Looks Like You</a></h3>

<p>The Number Twelve Looks Like You seems to be one of the most overlooked bands in recent memory. I never hear anyone talk about them, yet they have outdone themselves musically album after album, and they continue to be a group whose releases I really look forward to. Unfortunately, the band broke up in November. The most technical of mathcore dominates <em>Worse Than Alone</em>, with time signature shifts, key changes, and varying tempos galore, this album requires your full attention. What a parting gift for their fans.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/them-crooked-vultures_them-crooked-vultures_2009.jpg" alt="The Crooked Vultures by Them Crooked Vultures" /></p>

<h3 id="them-crooked-vultures-by-them-crooked-vultureshttpwwwlastfmmusicthemcrookedvulturesthemcrookedvultures"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Them+Crooked+Vultures/Them+Crooked+Vultures">Them Crooked Vultures by Them Crooked Vultures</a></h3>

<p>I had the immense pleasure to see Mssrs. Homme, Grohl, and Jones in Austin, TX at the Austin City Limits music festival in October. No one knew any of their songs, but everyone knew that they were listening to something special. And who should expect anything less from this trio? The pounding tempo change at the end of <em>No One Loves Me And Neither Do I</em> leaves you in awe, and, if for no other reason, see them live for the intro to <em>Elephants</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7744-the-top-50-albums-of-2009/">outstanding</a> <a href="http://www.spin.com/gallery/40-best-albums-2009">end-of-year</a> top album lists have been out there for a few weeks. I took it upon myself to come up with a list of my favorite music of the past year. 2009 was such a great year for music, and it was tough for me to come up with a list of just ten albums to share. </p>

<p>There were many great releases that didn’t make my own cut, and I want to highlight them here. Here’s part one of my list.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/john-frusciante_the-empyrean_2009.jpg" alt="The Empyrean by John Frusciante" /></p>

<h3 id="the-empyrean-by-john-frusciantehttpwwwlastfmmusicjohnfrusciante"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Frusciante">The Empyrean by John Frusciante</a></h3>

<p>I knew I had hit come upon something special from the moment I heard its nine minute opener, <em>Before the Beginning</em>, but it was Frusciante’s cover of Tim Buckley’s <em>Song to the Siren</em> that made me fall in love with <em>The Empyrean</em>. Other highlights include the cheesy synthesized drums, groovy bassline, and ooh-ing chorus line of <em>Dark/Light</em> and Frusciate’s warbled but earnest vocals on <em>Enough of Me</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-antlers_hospice_2009.jpg" alt="Hospice by The Antlers" /></p>

<h3 id="hospice-by-the-antlershttpwwwlastfmmusictheantlershospice"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Antlers/Hospice">Hospice by The Antlers</a></h3>

<p>I haven’t had a chance to listen to any of Peter Silberman’s solo work (also released under the name The Antlers), but if the full-band concept album <em>Hospice</em> is any indication, I need to get right on that. This album contains some of the saddest lyrics that I have ever heard, but, paired with some excellent song-writing, that’s a good thing.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/august-burns-red_constellations_2009.jpg" alt="Constellations by August Burns Red" /></p>

<h3 id="constellations-by-august-burns-redhttpwwwlastfmmusicaugustburnsredconstellations"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/Constellations">Constellations by August Burns Red</a></h3>

<p>Matt Greiner’s drumming skills are the first thing that strike you when opener <em>Thirty and Seven</em> first pounds through your head. Of course, every member of this band is a talented musician, as showcased on such standout tracks as <em>Ocean of Apathy</em> and <em>Meddler</em>. I must have listened to this album a thousand times while on my way to work over the summer, and it got me pumped every single day.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-dear-hunter_life-and-death_2009.jpg" alt="Act III: Life and Death by The Dear Hunter" /></p>

<h3 id="act-iii-life-and-death-by-the-dear-hunterhttpwwwlastfmmusicthedearhunter"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Dear+Hunter">Act III: Life and Death by The Dear Hunter</a></h3>

<p>Part three of a continuing saga, <em>Life and Death</em> sees The Dear Hunter’s mixture of baroque pop and progressive rock flesh out into something even more grandiose than the previous two chapters. I only found out about Casey Crescenzo’s project a few weeks before the release of this album, but I quickly caught up on Acts I and II. This album has such an epic feeling, and that’s something that they bring to their live show, too. When I saw them in Raleigh, they opened with a rendition of <em>Writing on a Wall</em> that was indistinguishable from the album version, and later had The Fall of Troy vocalist and guitarist Thomas Erak join them for <em>Red Hands</em> (a track from Act II).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-fall-of-troy_in-the-unlikely-event_2009.jpg" alt="In the Unlikely Event by The Fall of Troy" /></p>

<h3 id="in-the-unlikely-event-by-the-fall-of-troyhttpwwwlastfmmusicthefalloftroyintheunlikelyevent"><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Fall+of+Troy/In+the+Unlikely+Event">In the Unlikely Event by The Fall of Troy</a></h3>

<p>The Fall of Troy have one of the most intense and insane live shows around. Vocalist and guitarist Thomas Erak seems to enter his own world on stage, and you can’t help but be sucked into it. <em>In the Unlikely Event</em> does a pretty good job of capturing that energy. There are few more sections of clean vocals on this album than on previous efforts, and one can certainly detect an overall effort to broaden the group’s musical horizons. <em>Panic Attack!</em> and slower-than-usual <em>Webs</em> are two favorites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recorded my <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thrice/_/Red+Sky">fifty thousandth scrobble</a> to Last.fm at the beginning of this past August. I recently found <a href="http://kastuvas.us.to/lastfm/">a site that can generate the dates</a> on which you reached certain “milestones” in your scrobbling history. Since I have a rather large data set, I thought it would be neat to visualize my listening over the past four years.</p>

<p>This first image is a graph of the number of days it took me to listen to one thousand tracks. Looking at the chart, I can tell that I have been taking longer to listen to the same amount of music, but I have no idea why. It also seems that I have recently started going through phases of listening to a relatively large amount of music and then stopping, rinsing, and repeating. </p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2560/4048331825_bd657807bb_o.png" alt="Last.fm Milestones — Differences" /></p>

<p>The next image just corroborates what the other chart implicated: I don’t listen to music as much as I used to. It shows a graph of the moving average of the number of days it takes me to listen to my next one thousand tracks. I bet that a graph that charts when and how much music is added to my iTunes library would both match up with these charts and show a significant slowdown over the past few months and years.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2437/4049077916_109ae05991_o.png" alt="Last.fm Milestones — Average" /></p>

<p>There are fifty one milestones in these charts represented by forty five different artists. Four different artists appear more than once. There are no individual songs that appear more than once. My <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/charts?rangetype=overall&subtype;=artists">top three overall artists</a> appear on the list, as do five of my top ten.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: It seems that Yahoo! has changed their weather URL formats, which breaks the script that fetches the weather image. In order to fix it, go to <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Weather</a> and enter your desired location. Once you have the correct page loaded, replace the URL in the script with this new one. The script should start working again.</p>

<p>There’s no question that my post that describes my script to <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2008/04/yahoo-weather-feeds-with-python/">get the current weather conditions with Python and Yahoo! weather feeds</a> is the most popular post on my site. It drives a huge proportion of the (small amount of) traffic that this site gets, and the post has many more comments than the average post.</p>

<p>Many <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/megatrond/3100049946/">people</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/donnyboy09/3436467554/">post</a> images of their desktops in their best GeekTool getup, including ones that feature my weather script. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mgastongrillo/3858032308/">One of these in particular</a> had a lovely image to go along with his weather conditions. The author, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mgastongrillo/">Gato’s</a>, was kind enough to share how he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mgastongrillo/3858032308/#comment72157622208211629">retrieved and displayed this image</a> in the comments of the photo post. I love this idea, and tweaked Gato’s’ method. I thought I’d detail what I did in case anyone else is interested.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2615/3951420535_9a3d34e105_o.png" alt="Partly Cloudy" /></p>

<p>Gato’s’ method of retrieving Yahoo!’s weather images involves <em>two</em> additional GeekTool entries: one to fetch the image, and one to display the image on the desktop. I knew that there was a better way to do this, and I knew it involved <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html"><code>launchd</code></a>. <code>launchd</code> is a system-wide service for starting and stopping daemons. It replaced <code>init</code>, <code>cron</code>, and many other utilities in OS X 10.4. You can find out a lot more on the previous link and on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>I had never used <code>launchd</code> before, but setting up my own entry was fairly straightforward after I read a couple of the related man pages. In particular, <a href="x-man-page://launchd.plist"><code>launchd.plist</code></a> and <a href="x-man-page://execvp"><code>execvp</code></a> were very useful. In order to get started, you need to use the Property List Editor, found in <code>/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Property List Editor.app</code>. If you do not have Apple’s developer tools installed, you can create an XML file with a <code>.plist</code> extension with the same contents.</p>

<p>Before we start creating a <code>launchd</code> item, we need the script for the item to run. I have provided a bash script version of Gato’s’ image-grabbing command. I added a fifteen second timeout argument to the initial <code>curl</code> call; this prevents long timeouts for those times that you are without a network connection. You will also need to replace the URL at the end of line three of the script with your weather forecast URL. Simply go to the <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! weather page</a> and put in your zip or location code in order to retrieve your weather page, then paste that page’s URL into the script. You can <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/get_weather_image.sh.zip">download the script here</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can create the property list that will launch our image-grabbing script. <code>launchd</code> works by parsing a particular format of property list file. The man page for <a href="x-man-page://launchd.plist"><code>launchd.plist</code></a> is very extensive and contains documentation on the entries that are allowed in a <code>launchd</code> item. If that is all a bit too dense, I will walk through the creation of a simple <code>launchd</code> item with the bare minimum of properties needed to launch our script.</p>

<p>Open Property List Editor.app and create a new item by clicking <strong>Add Item</strong> in the toolbar. In the <strong>Key</strong> column, type <code>Label</code>. The default <strong>Type</strong> is <em>string</em>, so type a label identifier in the <strong>Value</strong> column. I used <code>com.thomasupton.fetchweatherimage</code>. You can use whatever you like. Next, add another item and this time switch its <strong>Type</strong> to <em>boolean</em>. Type <code>KeepAlive</code> as the <strong>Key</strong> and don’t check the check box to leave its value as <code>false</code>. Add another <em>number</em> item called <code>StartInterval</code> and give it a value of <code>600</code>. Finally, add an <em>array</em> item called <code>ProgramArguments</code>. Add a child to this array (just click the <strong>Add Item</strong> button with the <code>Program Arguments</code> node selected) and give it a value of <code>/bin/bash</code>. Add a second child and give it a value of <code>/absolute/path/to/script/get_weather_image.sh</code>, with the <em>absolute</em> path to where you saved the script. I have pasted the XML contents of the file here, and you can <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/com.thomasupton.fetchweatherimage.plist">download the property list file here</a>. You can open the property list with a text editor to edit the contents if you do not have the Property List Editor installed.</p>

<p>What we have just created is a <code>launchd</code> item that will only start on demand every 600 seconds and run our script to grab the weather image. Save the property list to <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents</code> and give it a name like <em>com.thomasupton.fetchweatherimage.plist</em>. Open Terminal.app and type the following command to load our new <code>launchd</code> item, replacing the name of the script with the file name that you saved your property list as.</p>

<pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.thomasupton.fetchweatherimage.plist
</code></pre>

<p>Back in GeekTool, all you need to do is add one new entry. Make it a picture and give it the URL <code>file:///tmp/weather.png</code>. <em>Et voilà</em>, you have a beautiful image of your weather conditions on your desktop.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/3946891446/">took a picture of my current desktop</a> to show you what it looks like. I gave the weather image an opacity of 60% for a more subtle effect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently started working at <a href="http://www.mailtrust.com/" title="Business Email Hosting &amp; Webmail Services Mailtrust">Mailtrust</a> in Blacksburg, VA. Mailtrust is a division of <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" title="Dedicated Server - Dedicated Server Hosting - Managed Dedicated Server by Rackspace">Rackspace</a>, a company that has been experiencing some astounding growth recently. One of the companies that Rackspace recently acquired is <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/" title="Slicehost - VPS Hosting">Slicehost</a>. Last week, I decided to sign up for Slicehost hosting and move my website to this new server. I also decided to buy a new domain, <strong>thomasupton.com</strong>. I spent the last week or so setting up my server just how I wanted it.</p>

<p>I followed the excellent <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/" title="Slicehost Article Repository - VPS setup, servers, Ruby on Rails, Django, PHP, DNS, Slicemanager and more">Slicehost articles</a> in order to get started. Setup is a breeze because you have total control over your server. When I screwed something up shortly after starting the setup process, I simply rebuilt and re-imaged my slice and started over.</p>

<p>The articles for <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download" title="Download Ubuntu Ubuntu">Ubuntu 8.10</a> are presented in a useful order and detail how to set up and secure a new slice, install Apache to serve websites, and install MySQL and PHP to start getting things done.</p>

<p>By far the hardest part of setting all of this up was the migration of my <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="WordPress › Blog Tool and Publishing Platform">Wordpress</a> installation. I spent a lot of time trying to export a MySQL dump of my existing Wordpress database and import onto my slice. It turns out that <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/06/12/xml-import-export/" title="XML Import / Export « Blog « WordPress.com">Wordpress supports an extended XML-based format for importing and exporting</a> almost every bit of user-created content, including posts, comments, and pages. Existing URL structures are preserved, and author data can be changed to an existing author in the new installation. This was <em>much</em> easier to do than my attempt to directly import a MySQL dump.</p>

<p>After I installed and migrated Wordpress, I decided that I wanted to redesign the look of the site. I wanted an article-centric design that took a minimalist approach to the extreme. What I needed was a skeleton Wordpress template that had useful, semantic markup that was easily customizable. Enter <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/" title="Sandbox plaintxt.org">Sandbox</a>. After activating the theme, designing a layout purely in CSS was extremely easy, thanks in large part to the clear and concise HTML markup. I’m still tweaking the design here and there, and I want to add a dedicated Archives page, but I’m really happy with how the site has turned out so far.</p>

<p>As I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, my interest was rekindled in <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/" title="Tumblr">Tumblr</a> after the release of version five. Tumblr supports custom domains, so I’ve moved my tumblelog to <a href="http://thisis.thomasupton.com/" title="This Is Thomas">This Is Thomas</a>.</p>

<p>I’m really hoping to have more time to blog about issues and topics that I care about now that I don’t have class and homework to worry about. The site is continually undergoing changes in design and structure as I learn more about how to write and design more effectively.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.10</a> on my old Dell Latitude D800. I had not used that machine in a couple of years, and I had forgotten about a few hardware issues that it had. One of the most annoying issues was the “drifting” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick">pointing stick</a>.</p>

<p>According to a number of posts I found when searching for solutions to the problem, the drifting pointing stick issue is a common one on many Dell models. It causes random and erratic mouse movement, making it nigh impossible to operate a graphical interface. I got around the issue when I was using this machine full time by disabling the pointing stick using the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;releaseid=R89598&amp;SystemID=LAT_PNT_PM_D600&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;deviceid=2514&amp;devlib=0&amp;typecnt=1&amp;vercnt=6&amp;formatcnt=1&amp;fileid=116869">Windows driver for the ALPS GlidePoint</a>. Unfortunately, the system preferences offered by Ubuntu do not have an option to disable the pointing stick.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=107521">a post on the Ubuntu forums</a> from a user who had a similar problem to mine. A responder mentioned that he removed the keyboard and found that the pointing stick had its own leads that could be disconnected. I searched for the <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/latd800/sm_en/keyboard.htm">Dell support document that matched my model</a> and decided that I, too, could remove my keyboard and disconnect the pointing stick.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not take any pictures of my machine when I had it opened. However, it is <em>very</em> easy to remove the keyboard by following the instructions in the support document. Once the machine was open and the keyboard removed, I just ripped off the leads from the pointing stick where they attached back to the keyboard connector. To be safe, I taped the loose end with electrical tape. After I replaced the keyboard, the trackpad and keyboard both worked fine and were not marred by the erratic mouse movement that was caused by my pointing stick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I interviewed earlier this week, I was given a developer take-home test to complete as part of the application process. The test consists of six short coding problems, any three of which are required to be completed within 48 hours of receiving the test.</p>

<p>I do not think there are any issues with me posting the problems here, and I want to share my solutions. Just to be safe, I’ll only post the three problems that I answered along with only some of my solution and methodology.</p>

<p>The problems could be answered in any of Java, C#, C/C++, Python, or PHP. I answered all three in Python. I wrote 227 lines of code for this test, including comments.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a program that justifies a given line of text to the specified width. The width is given on the first line of the input file, and the text in on the second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sample input:</p>

<pre><code>20
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>The quick  brown fox
jumps  over the lazy
dog.
</code></pre>

<p>The algorithm I came up with split the input into a list of words. Then, I keep popping those words off of that list and into a new list until no more words can fit within the specified width. Using the length of each word in the list plus a space between each word (<code>len(" ".join(to_justify))</code>), one can figure out the number of required spaces.</p>

<p>I decided that I would distribute the required spaces one by one into each “slot” that requires spaces until there are no more remaining spaces. This means that for the first <code>x</code> slots, there would be <code>n</code> spaces, and for the remaining <code>number_of_slots - x</code> slots, there would be <code>n - 1</code> spaces. <code>number_of_slots</code> here is really just <code>len(to_justify) - 1</code>.</p>

<p>The formulas for coming up with <code>n</code> and <code>x</code> are related and fairly straightforward. In terms of modulo arithmetic, think of the slots as your modulo, adding a space to each slot as you traverse the slots. We can use an example to illustrate this. If you have a desired text width of 20 characters, and a current word length of 13 characters, you need 7 spaces. For the first <code>7 % 4 = 3</code> slots, you need <code>ceil(7 / 4) = 2</code> spaces, and for the last slot, you need 1 (which is also <code>floor(7  /4)</code> or just <code>7 / 4</code> in Python) space. You need to import the <code>math</code> module in order to access the <code>math.ceil</code> function.</p>

<p>A problem that arises with this method is words that are longer than a line. I got around this by printing the word in chunks of the maximum width until its length was less than that text width. <code>words_printed</code> is just a count of the number of words that have been printed on the line thus far. It was used instead of <code>len(to_justify)</code> for use in another section of the code.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a program that compacts a string in place. It should remove all whitespace and replace duplicate characters with only the first character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sample input:</p>

<pre><code>abb cddpddef gh
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>abcdpdefgh
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>re</code> module made this one extremely easy. After grabbing the line from the input file, my entire solution consisted of one line.</p>

<pre><code>print re.compile(r'(.)1+', re.IGNORECASE).sub(r'g&lt;1&gt;', "".join(text.split()))
</code></pre>

<p><code>split()</code> defaults to a whitespace delimiter and <code>join()</code> pushes an array into a string with the given delimiter. This removes all the whitespace in a string.</p>

<p><code>re.compile()</code> takes a regular expression string as its argument and returns an <code>re</code> object instance. This object instance can then utilize a great many methods related to regular expressions. A lot more information can be found on <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" title="re -- Regular expression operations -- Python v2.6.1 documentation">the Python docs site</a>. Building a string with <code>r' '</code> tells Python to treat the string literally, e.g. the string <code>r'\n'</code> is two characters long (<code>\</code> then <code>n</code>). I passed the <code>re.IGNORECASE</code> flag to, well, ignore the case of the searched string.</p>

<p>We can break down the regular expression into three segments. First, <code>(.)</code> creates a character group that matches nearly any non-whitespace character. This lets me match both numbers and letters. <code>1</code> lets me match that first character group exactly. <code>(..)</code> or <code>(.){2,}</code> or something similar would not work, as that would match any two characters in a row and not just duplicates. Lastly, <code>+</code> lets me match the previous group 1 or more times. In English, this regular expression says “match any character, then match that exact character 1 or more times directly after it.”</p>

<p>The <code>sub</code> method allows me to substitute using regular expressions. I passed it our string that has gone through <code>split()</code> and <code>join()</code>, and tell it to replace any matches with the first group (<code>1</code>). Since this group only matches single characters, I am done. Regular expressions are powerful.</p>

<h2 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Print a 2D array in a clockwise spiral fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sample input:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5
</code></pre>

<p>I decided that this problem could be attacked using recursion. I quickly looked online for an example of what others had done, but they all seemed sloppy and inefficient. If I could write a function that printed the borders of an array in the desired order, I could recursively process the entire array.</p>

<p>I constructed the array by using <code>split()</code> on each each line of the input file, one by one. If the array passed to <code>print_borders()</code> has one row or one column, it prints it. If it has two rows, it prints the first row in order, and the second row backwards. Otherwise, it prints the top row in order, the right column in order, the bottom row in reverse, and the left column in reverse.</p>

<p>The <code>reversed()</code> top-level method produces an iterator on a list in reverse. This was very useful for the bottom row and left column. This is how I addressed the bottom row of the array:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">reversed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]):</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Using <code>array[-1]</code> also came in handy for the right column of the array:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>And also for extracting the part of the array that still needs to be processed:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="n">new_array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">array</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
</span><span class="line">  <span class="n">new_array</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">row</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I think the idea of a developer test is great. It allows the interviewers a brief glimpse into what kind of worker or programmer you are, and it gives the applicant a sense of accomplishment. The fact that I knew how to attack and solve these problems also gave me some confidence in my own programming skills. Being a recent college graduate and not having much professional programming experience meant that I had no idea what to expect. Now I do, and I’m excited. I got the job, and I very much look forward to starting work.</p>
