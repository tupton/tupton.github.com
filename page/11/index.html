  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Apple has <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/?p=60">changed the behavior of iTunes</a>.  Thank you, Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/85834383/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/85834383_485619a2e0_o.png" alt="iTmS - iTunes Mini Store" /></a></p>

<p>Apple updated iTunes on Tuesday, and yesterday, pretty much the whole Apple blogosphere went off the wall talking about how Apple now infringes on basic privacy rights with a new feature called the iTunes Mini Store (iTmS?).  I decided I needed to weigh in on this whole hooplah. <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html">Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing</a> first alerted me to what was going on.  As usual, he was concerned for the privacy of iTunes users, and, as expected, preached the end of his Apple fanboy days if Apple phoned home about his listening habits. The <a href="http://since1968.com/article/153/itunes-is-watching">blog post that Cory linked to</a> over at <a href="http://since1968.com">since1968.com</a> was quite alarmist, but the concern was valid.  Marc Garret, the author of the blog, then <a href="http://since1968.com/article/154/itunes-update-update">posted a rebuttal</a> to all the comments on the original post.  In it, he makes some good points and debunks some ridiculous claims (“Dude, you should know that Apple is collecting the information because it couldn’t display related songs without it.” What?)</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/01/11/1619259">the story reached Slashdot</a>.  Some commenters were taken aback and angry at Apple, while others tried to make it clear that Apple was doing nothing to infringe on anybody’s rights.  Still others made it out that Apple apologists were trying to defend Apple’s evil intentions, and that if Microsoft was doing the same thing with WMP then everyone would be up in arms about the whole situation.</p>

<p>This morning, <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/">The Apple Blog</a> <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/2006/01/11/itunes-knows-where-you-live-and-its-going-to-hunt-you-down/">weighed in on the issue</a>, and these are the points that I agree most with.</p>

<p><a href="http://since1968.com/article/153/itunes-is-watching#c000084">I was one of the early commenters on the since1968 post</a>, and I maintain that if Apple does not store the information (<a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/editors/2006/01/ministore/index.php">as reported by MacWorld</a>) that is sent to the Music Store then no data-mining is occuring.  This is more akin to having an RSS feed of an artist’s works displayed as you listen, or performing a search on the iTMS and retrieving the results automatically.</p>

<p>However, I find it a little strange that Apple made no mention of this feature on Tuesday, and they make no reference to how the data is used in any of THREE license argreements associated with iTunes and the Music Store.  The most disconcerting aspect of this is WHERE the information is going.  <a href="http://5ives.com/">Merlin Mann</a> discovered that packets are being sent to <a href="http://2o7.net/">2o7.net</a>, a website of a known marketing company.  My question is, if Apple is not collecting information, is another company doing just that for them?  I have no problem with Apple knowing my listening habits; the Recommendations over at <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> is one of my favorite features and they are normally bang on.  I DO have an issue with the feature not being explained and it being opt-out instead of opt-in (but I suppose Amazon’s Recommendations are opt-out, too), but the fact that no data is sent when the mini store is closed not only makes sense, but goes a long way in describing Apple’s intentions.  They just want to sell more music, and I DO NOT have an issue with that.</p>

<p>For the record, I turned the mini store off. This has little to do with online privacy, though.  The mini-store takes up way too much space, even on my 20” Cinema Display, and I do not want to know what albums I’m missing in an artist’s discography (I might be compelled to spend even MORE money!)  Here’s to hoping that the feature will be opt out in the next update to iTunes and that a section is added to the iTunes license agreement that explains what is going on with this data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sucks.</p>

<p>Sure, Apple’s money-maker has been praised the world over for both hardware design and ease of use, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t have a few suggestions.</p>

<p>My music library is over 12000 songs large, and growing.  I have over 300 separate artists, and almost 800 albums.  Getting to what I want to listen on a small screen with no alphanumerics is a feat that I am so happy that Apple spent some time making easy.  However, the system is far from perfect.  Here is a list of three features I want to see in the future regarding iPod navigation.</p>

<h3 id="album-art-based-navigation-in-both-artist-and-album-categories">Album art-based navigation in both Artist and Album categories</h3>

<p>This is sorely needed.  With the newest iPods able to play video, it should be relatively easy to transfer that nifty photo navigation system to album art.  Put the album title in the title bar at the top of the screen, and have a generic placeholder image for albums that don’t have album art, and we could really have portable jukeboxes!</p>

<h3 id="descending-sort">Descending Sort</h3>

<p>Just put an option at the top of every screen to re-sort in ascending or descending order.  Please.</p>

<h3 id="better-playlist-navigation">Better Playlist Navigation</h3>

<p>The current way of navigating playlists is horrific for playlists longer than about twenty songs.  My Recently Added and Genre-based playlists are totally useless on the iPod.  What about giving options for a multi-line display, showing artist and album in addition to track name, on the iPod?  Sure, there would be less items on the small screen, but that is a fair tradeoff for the benefit of being able to actually use large playlists. There is one thing that I do think that Apple got one hundred percent right, and that is the ability of the click wheel to navigate large lists efficiently.</p>

<p>I am sure that I will come up with something else as the issues that are associated with large music libraries surface during my use of my iPod.  I know that Apple will probably never see this, but here’s to hoping!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> recently <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/stuck_systems.html">posted about his trouble generating a bibliography</a> for a student friend of his.  This got me thinking.</p>

<p>With all this hoo-hah about Web 2.0 and AJAX and GTD and this or that new buzzword, I feel that sometimes we lose sight of the fact that all of this technology is supposed to help us.  Sometimes I get so bogged down with the <a href="http://pack.google.com/pack_installer_required.html">newest web-based utility offering from Google</a> or the <a href="http://flickr.com/news.gne">next new feature on Flickr</a> that I forget that I actually don’t know what this is all for.  Don’t get me wrong:  there are some awesomely useful apps out there (Gmail, Quicksilver, Adium, NetNewsWire, etc.), but they can all be so overwhelming in their newness that we forget how to take advantage of their usefulness.</p>

<p>Seth Godin comes up with a great point:  no one has come up with one of the most obviously useful applications for one of the most obviously mundane and useless tasks that students are required to do.  Who actually looks at a bibliography, and cannot function if it is not meticulously written and formatted perfectly?  Sure, it’s useful to see sources, but not in that form.  Like Mr. Godin says, cities of publication are not intrinsic upon knowing the material.</p>

<p>However, the fact remains that bibliographies are used in scholarly papers and middle school book reports alike.  They are a necessity. So why hasn’t anyone built a simple little webapp that queries an ISBN and page numbers, and returns a bibliography.  While we’re at it, why not include an automated bibliography for web pages, too?</p>

<p>Kudos to the person who does this and gets it right.  We all need it.  Just make sure it has enough eye-candy and extra whistles and bells to keep us away from those papers just a bit longer.</p>

<p>Since the advent of Firefox 1.5, my extension list has changed considerably since <a href="http://fiveuptons.com/thomas/blog/2005/06/firefox-extensions.html">last time</a>.  I’ll link to all of them, but I’ll just describe the new ones.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.clagnut.com/blog/340/">DOM Inspector</a> - This extension comes with Firefox, but on Windows you need to ask for it explicitly.  The extension itself lets you look at the document in the browser.  You can inspect the HTML and CSS of the web page, among other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1136">Adblock Filterset.G Updater</a> - This automatically uses the excellent <a href="http://pierceive.com/">Filterset.G</a> in Adblock.  It can run in the background, and you’ll never see an ad again!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=112">Last Tab</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://superdragandgo.mozdev.org/">Super DragAndGo</a> - This extension allows you to drag links up or down and open them in a foreground or background tab.  It’s wonderful for opening many news items at once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;version=1.0&amp;os=Windows&amp;id=241">Disable Targets For Download</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=58">Undoclosetab</a> - Just a quick note on this one, even though it’s not new.  In about:config, I changed “undoclosetab.tabmenu_position” to “5” to categorize the menu item with the other tab commands in the tab bar’s contextual menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">del.icio.us</a> - An excellent extension from the del.icio.us developers, this extension makes it easy to post and manage your bookmarks with Firefox.  I only wish the extension came with a keyboard shortcut to post bookmarks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1457">Viamatic Foxposé</a> - Adds a status bar icon and a keyboard shortcut to view all tabs at once, à la OS X’s Exposé.  Very neat, and quite useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/tabsidebar/index.html">Tab Sidebar</a> - This extension adds sidebar support for tabs, complete with thumbnails and navigation buttons.  I made an OS X skin for it, available <a href="http://fiveuptons.com/thomas/blog/2005/11/tab-sidebar.html">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/qfa.html">Talkback</a>
This extension comes with Firefox.  It is a crash-logger and data-collector for the Mozilla foundation.  They can analyze crash data if it is utilized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/tabpreview/">Tab Preview</a> - Using a quick drawing method, this extension gives a thumbnail preview of each tab when you mouse over the tab at the top of the window.  It’s very useful, and doesn’t clutter the UI like you think it would.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> - Greasemonkey was recently updated with full compatability with FF1.5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/tabx">Tab X</a> - This extension removes the default “close tab” buttom from the upper right of the browser window and places a close button on every tab.  It was recently updated to work on OS X, and I think it’s wonderful.  It’s much easier to hit that button than it is to have to move the mouse over so far for each tab.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of these extensions require <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox 1.5</a>, so don’t go trying to install these if you’re still using a 1.0.x release.</p>

<p>The amazing <a href="http://users.blueprintit.co.uk/~dave/web/firefox/tabsidebar/index.html">Tab Sidebar</a> Firefox extension was recently updated, breaking my <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/?p=43">earlier Mac OS X UI improvements</a>.

<p><a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/tab_sidebar_mac_widgets.zip">Here are the new files</a>.

<p>I’ll outline the steps that I took to make this work, because that wiki is not so helpful.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to <a href="http://feeddigest.com/">Feed Digest</a>.  This is a website that takes an RSS feed and parses it how you want into HTML.  The service also offers a mix of multiple feeds, but we don’t need that for Last.fm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a digest from your Last.fm feed.  The format is http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/<username>/recenttracks.rss, where <username> is replaced by your Last.fm user name.</username></username></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit the template of your feed.  I used</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>&lt;li class="music"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="%URL%" &gt;%TITLE%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>for the per-item template and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://last.fm/user/Tupton"&gt;Recently Played Tracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>for the header template.  This makes a list out of your tracks, allowing for better CSS styling.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get the code for your feed.  After creating the feed, you can get a Javascript implementation of your feed to include in your site.  All the code you need is offered on the site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the HTML in your web page.  I enclosed the Javascript include in a div, for greater editing ease.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Style, baby!  Here is the CSS I used to make this work:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<pre><code>#lastfm {
padding: 3px;
margin-top: 5px;
border: #ddd solid 1px;
background-color: #f8f8f8;
font-size: 1em;
}
 #lastfm a:hover {
color: #fff;
background-color: #39c;
}
 #lastfm p {
font-size: 12px;
font-weight: bold;
}
 #lastfm ul {
margin-left: -40px;
}
 #lastfm li.music {
font-size: 10px;
line-height: 2em;
padding: 2px;
margin-bottom: 3px;
background-color: #fff;
border-top: 1px #ddd solid;
border-bottom: 1px #ddd solid;
list-style-image:url('http://www.fiveuptons.com/thomas/images/audio.gif');
}
 #lastfm li.music:hover {
background-color: #39c;
}
 #lastfm li.music:hover a {
color: #fff;
}
 #lastfm li.music a {
display: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The image I used for the list bullet was an edited image from the BBC.  Feel free to use it, but just save it on your own server so you aren’t hot-linking to my images, please.  Also, a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=speaker.gif&amp;hl=en">Google search for speaker.gif</a> yields some nice results.  You can see the image I used is the third one there.</p>

<p>You can see the final result of what I did on my <a href="http://fiveuptons.com/thomas/">main page</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
