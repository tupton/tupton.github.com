  <div class="entry-content"><p>Really. My microwave helpfully makes the numbers 1 through 6 shortcuts for running for that number of minutes, on full power. When’s the last time you needed to microwave something for <em>six whole minutes</em>?</p>

<p>Most of my microwaving involves re-heating leftovers or softening things like tortillas or butter. These things don’t take minutes; they take <em>seconds</em>. And if I have something that really need to warm up over the course of one or two minutes, it certainly doesn’t need to be that long at full power. Those preset buttons are absolutely useless. I need presets for 10, 20, and 30 seconds, and maybe 90, and at power levels of 5, 7, and “hi”. Not “high”, mind you, “hi”.</p>

<p>The rest of my microwaving time is spent trying to defrost frozen meat, like a chicken breast or a tilapia filet. There’s a button for this, yes, but it requires that I guess the weight of the thing I’m defrosting. I don’t own a kitchen scale, but even if I did, I sure as hell wouldn’t bust it out to figure out how to long I need to defrost my meat. Let me tell you what I’m defrosting, and then figure out how long to defrost it. Defrosting is not a new science or even science at all.</p>

<p>Here’s another irksome feature: when I open the microwave door before the timer goes off, I really appreciate that it remembers how much time was left. Once eight hours have passed, though, I think it’s safe to assume that I’m no longer in need of that timer. “PRESS START” is not helpful after that long. Show me the clock again after a reasonable amount of time has passed.</p>

<p>Another thing: that awful beeping sound. I know some smug person with too much time on his hands has Googled his unit’s manual and has memorized the arcane sequence of button presses required to mute the microwave, but I haven’t. Why is there not just a mute button? It’s not for lack of room: put it under my “9 “ button or in between “Defrost” and “Popcorn” (which always burns those poor defenseless kernels) or even in the place of the “Reminder” button, because I don’t keep my todo list on my microwave.</p>

<p>Can someone “<a href="http://www.nest.com/">Nest</a>-ify” the microwave? I would buy one in a heartbeat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Starting a fresh environment on a new system isn’t a very common or regular task, but when you do, it comes in handy to have a quick and easy way to do it. To help with this, I keep my <code>vim</code> <a href="https://github.com/tupton/vim-support">environment</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/tupton/dotfiles">environment dot files</a> in version control on Github.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> to manage my <code>vim</code> plugins. I follow the examples in <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/">this great article on plugin management with Pathogen</a> to keep most of my plugins as <code>git</code> submodules. Installing my <code>vim</code> environment is just a matter of cloning the <code>git</code> repository and symlinking my <code>vimrc</code>.</p>

<p>I just spent some time cleaning up and organizing my dotfiles.  I wasn’t even using my old dotfiles repository on GitHub, but I quickly rectified that. I now keep my dotfiles in <code>~/.dotfiles</code> and symlink them to <code>~</code>. There is a helper script in my <a href="https://github.com/tupton/dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a> that sets up these symlinks.</p>

<p>Along with the usual <code>bashrc</code>, there are a few config files that aren’t as common. My <code>ackrc</code> defines a few convenient options and ignores directories with built artifacts in them. My (old) <code>pythonrc</code> defines a tab-completion function, although this might be outdated at this point. There’s a <code>tm_properties</code> config for <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">TextMate 2</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully the fact that my configuration is out in the open will bring to light some useful features that I probably take for granted but you might not know about. So, go explore! Check out my <code>inputrc</code>, for example. I know that I discover new things almost every time I look at someone else’s <code>vimrc</code> or <code>bashrc</code>.</p>

<p>Do you have any configuration tips or tricks? Let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7164/6654753833_ab1c242b36_z_d.jpg" alt="Coffee" /></p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTVE5iPMKLg">most of the world</a>, I love coffee. I usually drink a cup or two a day, and sometimes more. I’m lucky enough to live close to places that sell great coffee: Whole Foods roasts their own coffee, and there are numerous local places with great beans.</p>

<p>I usually make a full “batch” of coffee in a French press (or <em>сafetière</em>), but sometimes that’s too much. I know it’s considered blasphemous, but I got a Keurig single cup brewer for Christmas, and I absolutely love it. I was apprehensive about Keurig machines until I found out about refillable “K-Cups” that you could fill with your own, delicious coffee. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B000DLB2FI">official Keurig “My K-Cup”</a>, but that requires that you replace the entire holster mechanism each time. It’s not time consuming, but it is a bit annoying.</p>

<p>I discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ekobrew-Refillable-Keurig-Brewers-1-Count/dp/B0051SU0OW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1325967276&sr;=8-1">Ekobrew</a>, which is a filter that fits in the existing cup holster. Two of them are on their way to my house from Amazon right now.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it gets there, coffee from the Keurig is (perhaps surprisingly) pleasant. It’s not the best cup of coffee, but it’s quick, easy, and clean.</p>

<p>I still use the French press when I need to make a bigger batch of coffee or if I want to relax and enjoy a really great cup. I use the seemingly-ubiquitous Bodum French press and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0043095WW">burr grinder</a> and keep the coffee warm in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S56U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00004S56U">Zojirushi carafe</a>. Coffee stays <em>hot</em> for hours on end, so I can make coffee in the morning and still enjoy it later in the afternoon. How I make coffee just depends on how much I need and what kind of mood I’m in.</p>

<p>One last thing: I also got a small stovetop espresso maker for Christmas, and it is amazing. When I want a treat, I make myself a café Americano: a bit of espresso in a normal-sized coffee cup and filled the rest of the way with hot water. Yum!</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure</em>: I’ve linked to a number of products on Amazon in this post, and most of them contain my affiliate link. I’ll get a small kickback if anything is bought via these links. I will only ever post links to products that I use and love, and that is certainly the case with everything here. I’m passionate about my coffee, and I don’t want to mislead anyone. I have not included my affiliate link to the Ekobrew refillable K-Cup because I have not received or used it at this time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In light of some <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2011/12/19/my-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-mac-os-x-2011-edition-/">recent</a> <a href="http://collindonnell.com/blog/2012/1/4/essential-tools-2011.html">excellent</a> posts about tools that smart people use, here are my essential tools that I used in 2011.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>I use a 15” MacBook Pro i5 with 8 GB of RAM. It’s quick and does everything I need it to. It’s not <em>too</em> bulky, but it’s certainly bigger than my older 13” MacBook. I keep toying with the idea of a MacBook Air, but I can’t justify the cost and I don’t want to use two machines.</p>

<p>I connect to an Apple LED Cinema Display when I’m at my standing desk, and I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MMY4WY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B002MMY4WY">Logitech wireless keyboard</a> and an Apple Magic Trackpad.</p>

<p>I do <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2011/12/local-backups-are-great/">daily, local backups</a> to a smallish volume on a 1 TB hard drive. The rest of the drive holds my music, photos, and other media.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I do all of my work (both professionally and on this site) on VMs in “the cloud” that I <code>ssh</code> to with <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm 2</a>. I love that it can copy-on-select and the customizable colors are more robust than in other terminal apps. I used the built in Terminal.app for a long time, but the latest iTerm 2 is stable and excellent.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/">HTTP Client</a> to test our API, as well as both Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<p>When I write code, I usually use <a href="http://www.vim.org/"><code>vim</code></a>, but I’ve been testing out the recent alpha builds of <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">TextMate 2</a>.</p>

<p>When I write for this website or for my own personal notes, I’ve started using <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> to write and preview Markdown. Its fullscreen and “paragraph focus” modes are nice touches. I’ve heard good things about <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, which allows Markdown previews from any app, but I haven’t used it yet.</p>

<p>I’m not a huge calendar user, but I do keep track of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/events">shows I attend</a> and personal events on Google Calendar. I interact with my calendars with <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>. Its natural language event input is pretty great and lets me add events really quickly.</p>

<p>I work on and use a browser-based email client at work, but I also like to use <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a>. The minimal interface stays out of the way, but all my mail is available quickly. Shortcuts for reply and reply all make it easy to respond to threads. A nice little touch: Sparrow automatically picked up the fact that I had an IMAP folder called Archive in my work email and started using it when I press Delete to archive messages.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> all day every day. My usage statistics say I average 13.6 uses per day, but if you didn’t count weekends, holidays, or days that I don’t actually use my computer, I bet it’d be a lot higher. I <em>love</em> the clipboard management.</p>

<p>I occasionally use <a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">Cloud</a> to quickly upload screenshots, but I don’t use it for much else.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> to manage files, share some music with friends, and back up certain documents. I also store my (encrypted) <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> data on Dropbox so that I can access my passwords from anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://mizage.com/#macdivvy">Divvy</a> and <a href="http://cordlessdog.com/stay/">Stay</a> are two window management tools that I use all the time. When I disconnect from my display, Stay puts my windows back to where I want them. It doesn’t quite work with Chrome, but everything else works well. Divvy lets me resize windows on a custom-sized grid. You can even define shortcuts – I use “c” for a centered window and “6” for a window taking up 60% of the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>I recently started using <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, but I haven’t gotten into it just yet. I’ll have more to write about that when learn how to use it and actually start using it more. I do use <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/clearly.php">Evernote’s Clearly</a> browser extension to read articles on line.</p>

<p>For my musical pleasure throughout the day, I still use iTunes a lot of the time. However, <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> (with <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a>) is usually how I listen to music these days. Airfoil makes it easy to listen to music in my living room via my Apple TV.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed <a href="http://shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n">Lessn</a> and then <a href="http://lessnmore.net/">Lessn More</a> to take control of my own short links. Lessn is a very simple URL shortener that is hosted on my own domain.</p>

<p>I registered <a href="http://upton.in/">upton.in</a> to serve my short links. I chose the “.in” TLD because it’s short and common. I do wish there was an “.on” TLD so I could register <em>upt.on</em>, but I like the connotation of “in”. As <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasupton/status/154218836722335745">I said on Twitter the other day</a>, it can mean “Internet, inside, come in, infinity, interesting” among other things. </p>

<p>Lessn also integrates nicely with <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, which I recently started using. I plan to write more on that shortly.</p>

I’ve enjoyed playing it, just as I’ve enjoyed playing video games for nearly my entire life.</p>

<p>In recent years, however, I’ve abandoned or not fully played all of my video games. I attempted to maintain a Google Docs spreadsheet to keep track of my unplayed games, but it quickly became more neglected than the games themselves.</p>

<p>I recently found out about Shaun Inman’s <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2011/04/18/unplayed"><em>Unplayed</em></a>, and it seemed perfect. It’s like a much simpler, lightweight Shelfari for video games. You can now see which games I’m playing (or not playing) at my <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/unplayed/"><em>Unplayed</em> page</a>. For now, I’m going back to Skyloft!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first Christopher Nolan movie I saw was the incredible <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/"><em>Memento</em></a>. I’ve watched it many times since, and I always manage to catch something new. It’s a great movie the first and tenth time you watch it. It’s well-written – with some help from his brother Jonathan, who has helped out on other films since – and the attention to detail is incredible. </p>

<p>I think Nolan caught the attention of most of the movie-going public for his reboot of the Batman franchise. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/"><em>Batman Begins</em></a> is one of the best comic book translations, outdone only by its sequel, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/"><em>The Dark Knight</em></a>. Nolan wisely decided to take breaks between Batman films to make other films that he was interested in. He managed to pull this off because of his own production company, Syncopy Films, and his success as a director. As a result we’ve got two great films so far: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/"><em>The Prestige</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/"><em>Inception</em></a>.</p>

<p>I love that Nolan has focused on other projects that he’s passionate about to avoid creating anything “stale” or boring. I think there’s a larger lesson there that most people can take away. Sometimes you can make something better by <em>not</em> giving it attention.</p>

<p>If Nolan’s “interstitial” movies keep improving at the same rate, we’re in for a treat in 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently started using <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> on OS X and <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> on iOS for my writing in general. Both apps are <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editors that, in conjunction with Dropbox, let me write from nearly anywhere.</p>

<p>I write my blog posts in Markdown, but the format is useful for almost any kind of writing. Any application that can read plain text can read Markdown for those times that you need to keep it simple, or you can convert to HTML for when you want or need to make it a bit more presentable.</p>

<p>I love using Byword in its fullscreen and paragraph focus view. It’s a great way to minimize distractions with enough context to let you properly proofread your writing. The Markdown to HTML preview is a keyboard shortcut away, and saving to a folder in Dropbox means that I can access my files anywhere.</p>

<p>Elements requires a Dropbox account to work, so I specified the same folder that I save documents from Byword into. Et voilà, I can edit or add to a blog post or any other writing on my iPhone or iPad. Elements has a great Markdown preview, too, and it’s distraction-free (from other apps) by nature of being an iOS app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to make daily backups to my local hard drive. <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2010/12/automated-backups-with-tarsnap/">Remote backup</a> is important, but it’s always nice to have an easily-accessible way to recover from a hard drive disaster, especially when you need to fix the situation <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<h2 id="your-backup-device">Your Backup Device</h2>

<p>Choosing the right hard drive to use for your local backup isn’t a difficult choice, but it is an important one.  Sometimes you can find great deals on good brands (Western Digital or Seagate, to name a couple brands that I have used and liked) on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>. The requirements for a hard drive really depend on how you want to use it.</p>

<p>If you want a hard drive dedicated to backup, any drive with a relatively quick speed (I would go with 7200 RPM or higher) and a size that’s at least a bit bigger than the drive you’re backing up will be a great option.</p>

<p>If you want to use a hard drive for other things – to store your media or back up another drive – you’ll obviously need something bigger. I have a 1 TB drive that I have split into two volumes. One volume is a bit bigger than my MacBook Pro’s hard drive (128 GB)  and I use it to hold my backups; the other takes up the rest of the space and is used to store all of my music, movies, and photos.</p>

<p>Solid state drives are another option, but I’ve found that the extra cost isn’t worth the speed benefits. I would absolutely recommend a solid state drive to use in your main computer on a daily basis – I have a 128 GB solid state drive in my MacBook Pro and it’s noticeably faster than the mechanical hard drives I’ve used in MacBooks past. However, when it comes to something like backups, where you’re mostly writing to it in a situation that isn’t time-sensitive (e.g. at night), I think mechanical drives are the best option because you can get much more storage space for much less money.</p>

<h2 id="software-that-helps-you">Software That Helps You</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I use SuperDuper!, but there are many other backup applications out there. Some of them may fit your specific needs better. The key feature is to have an automated and <em>bootable</em> copy of your hard drive ready to go at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>I admittedly have not given Time Machine a fair shot, but that’s because I don’t have a use case for its main draw. “Going back in time” to an earlier version of a file is not something I need to do on a regular basis. And now with Lion’s Versions feature, I don’t need a whole backup just to keep recent versions of my files around.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://www.bombich.com/ccc_features.html">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. It makes bootable backups and can be scheduled to back up on a daily basis. It’s free to try; donations are requested if you continue to use the product.</p>

<p>I love SuperDuper! because it’s so simple. The interface tells you in plain English what is going to happen. I set up my nightly backups one time a couple years ago and the only time I ever see the app again is when I am traveling without my hard drive. When a backup fails, the application stays open to tell you what went wrong. That rarely happens though: usually an incremental backup occurs at 3am that takes less than ten minutes to complete. When it’s done, my data is safe and sound in two places.</p>

<p>The successful backups are bootable, meaning that you can just choose the backup volume as the boot volume when you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310">hold Option after you turn your computer on</a> and restore from there. If you just want to restore certain files instead of everything, the drive is right there in Finder for you to navigate as usual.</p>

<h2 id="backup-is-not-a-daunting-task">Backup Is Not a Daunting Task</h2>

<p>Almost none of my “non-technical” friends (i.e. friends who do other things in their lives besides fiddle with computers) back up their computers. And yet I know that each one of those friends would be devastated if their hard drive crashed and they lost their music or photos. Local backups are the simplest way to avoid this, and it’s so simple to set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy a hard drive (7200 RPM and at least as big as the drive you want to back up) and <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=1075">format it using OS X’s built-in Disk Utility</a>.</li>
  <li>Set up a <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">backup application</a> to do daily backups of your entire disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Back up your data. It’s so simple and so useful.</p>
