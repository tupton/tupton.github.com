  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4213214.stm">Surivors reveal Superdrome horror</a>, found via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/09/04/in_america.html">Boing Boing</a>.</p>

<p>This is America, the land of hope, oppurtunity, tolerance, and accountability.  In recent times, this statement becomes more and more idealistic and further away from the truth.</p>

<p>The disaster in New Orleans is horrendous enough.  Why does it take a tragedy like this to bring out the worst in people?  Who is to blame here?</p>

<p>The kneejerk reaction might be to point the finger at the poor, because they don’t know any better, or because they are only trying to survive.  Bullshit.  The scenario down there was controllable after the weather died down, and the organizers and leaders made mistakes.  Logistical errors were made, miscommunications are abound, and thousands upon thousands of people watched their lives worsen every day, even now, six days after the hurricane made landfall in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Rape, looting, pillaging, and violence are not tolerable.  Neither is violent retaliation against these egregious acts.  Army units are being brought in from Iraq, where they have little to no accountability for their actions against what the media has so popularly named the insurgency.  This does not insinuate that they will treat the citizens of New Orleans as if they were a threat to the well-being of America, but one must wonder about the validity of the choices being made by American armed forces.  Not only did help arrive much too late, but the organization of aid to Louisiana has been lacking to say the least.</p>

<p>Numerous stories pour in throughout the day regarding the limit of supplies and manpower.  The choice to make available all resources to all areas is not a hard one to make.  The fact that a man was killed trying to flag down help says it all.  What about the dozens of pirate bus drivers that risk incarceration to go where official rescue operations dare not.</p>

<p>People’s lives should not be governed by red tape.  Getting the help in there is only half the battle. Using manpower and resources responsibly and effectively are key to helping resolve this situation.</p>

<p>Hey! <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/gmail-helper/index.html">That’s cool</a>.  I especially like the line that says: “Though this is the first, it won’t be the last native Mac application that Google delivers. So please, Mac users, stay tuned!”</p>

<p>Thanks, Google!</p>

<p>The app is a tiny menu bar item that will replace <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/carsten.guenther/GmailStatus/">GmailStatus</a> as my Gmail notifier.  I like the fact that the option to show the number of unread messages is not a little haywire like it was in GmailStatus.</p>

<p>The only thing that is missing is Growl Support, but maybe some enterprising Machead will come up with a script for that.  I might make an update to this post after I’ve used it for a few days, but for now, this seems excellent!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It seems that I rely on Growl way more than I thought I did.  It must be the transparency with which Growl integrates into the system, but I love knowing when I get new mail via that lovely bubble notification.  Also, earlier when I said that the unread count isn’t all funky like Gmail Status, it wasn’t exactly true.  The notifier puts the number in parentheses next to the icon, which in turn changes the width of the menu bar icons according to how many unread messages I have.  Not cool; I’d much rather have an overlay.  I’ll keep trying Google’s app and see what, if any, updates come out.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/extras-for-your-mac-gmail-notifier.html">Gmail Notifier supports plugins</a>!  A plugin called <a href="http://www.wootest.net/gmailgrowl/">Gmail+Growl</a> adds Growl support, and I love it!  I took the images from Gmail Status (because they are so much cooler) and used them in Gmail Notifier.  Now I have an official Gmail notifier with Growl support that looks good doing it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a rather cryptic <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/08/28.html#a10979">post from Robert Scoble</a> concerning <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> the other day.  I had no idea what it was, whether it was MS related or not, but I decided to check it out.  Scoble normally has some interesting things to link to, whether his critics like to admit it or not.</p>

<p><a href="http://pandora.com/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/21/39895786_d58f686c78.jpg" alt="Pandora" /></a></p>

<p>For the past few years, the Music Genome Project has been listening and sorting thousands upon thousands of tracks of music.  They have eschewed the normal conventions of genre and classification and instead given each song a number of musical attribrutes, including tonality, harmonies, rhythm, and melody.  Pandora is the MGP’s gateway to the end user.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora.com</a> and you will be greeted by a simplistic web page with an embedded Flash application.  Simply enter the name of a group or song that you enjoy, and sit back.  Pandora searches the MGP database to find similar music to what you have defined.</p>

<p>You can create up to 100 stations, and the first ten hours of listening are totally free.  You don’t even need an email address to listen!</p>

<p>Try creating a station from one song, and then add what you think are similar songs to the same station.  Pandora will adapt and start churning out some awesome new music that you have never heard before but will be hopping on iTunes to grab immediately.</p>

<p>I love this concept, and I would like to see a more robust client (instead of a clunky Flash app.  <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ajax">Ajax</a> anyone?) and way more publicity.  Where is all the buzz about these guys?</p>

<p>I’ll keep giving Pandora a listen, and perhaps I’ll cough up the $36/year fee.  It seems a fair price for an almost endless supply of customized new music.  Plus, the fact that my Mars Volta station played two of my favorite Mars Volta songs, an At The Drive In song from the new compilation, and the bonus track that was not even included on Frances The Mute makes it a keeper in my book already.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, Slashdot had <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/23/1313229">two</a> <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/23/2316223">posts</a> concerning the release of an instant message client from Google.  This morning, Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/google-gets-to-talking.html">officially announced</a> the release of <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>.</p>

<p>I connected to the Google Talk service last night via <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> and <a href="http://www.smashsworld.com/2005/08/im-on-google-talk-right-now.php">one of the sites</a> that Slashdot linked to.</p>

<p>The fact that Adium so seamlessly integrates accounts is definitely a plus.  Messaging Google Talk contacts was totally transparent.</p>

<p>Google Talk has some excellent integration with <a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, too.  Try sending an gmail to another Gmail address:  That person is automatically added to your contact list.  If you manually add a contact to Google Talk, their alias info is automagically grabbed and implemented, while their email address is added to Gmail.</p>

<p>This is probably all part of Google’s world domination plans (is that not getting a <em>little</em> cliché?), but it’s so darn cool that I don’t care one snitch!  No message limit, unbelievable sychronicity, and the fact that it’s Google all make me wonder:  Can they take on <a href="http://www.aim.com/">AIM</a> and, more importantly, <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/">MSN</a>?</p>

<p>This may be old news, but Amazon seems to indicate which albums it sells are copy protected.  I haven’t looked to see if any other albums are flagged like this, but it seems that “Copy Protected CD” is one of the formats that is listed on
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature-pop-up/-/570000/ref=cd_format_pop/002-6181845-7529664">Amazon’s Buying Guide</a>.  When was this implemented, and do they catch all copy protected media?  Has anyone bought an seemingly normal album from Amazon only to find that it was copy protected?</p>

<p>Even though this indication is nice, a copy protected work is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc#Copy_protection">technically a CD</a>, but I think Amazon labeled it as such to reduce confusion.</p>

<p>This past Monday, Yahoo announced the purchase of desktop widget application <a href="http://konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a>.  With the purchase came the announcement that Konfabulator would be free, and anyone who bought version 2.0 or later would be eligible for a refund of the application’s former $20 charge.</p>

<p>I like Konfabulator <em>almost</em> better than Dashboard.  Dashboard seems to have <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/sysstat.html">more</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html">useful</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/music/symphonic.html">widgets</a>, while Konfabulator seems to have more <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=36689">“just for fun”</a> widgets.</p>

<p>However, Konfabulator offers cross-platform ubiquity and, with the involvment of Yahoo, an open API for developers to make the most of this potential content delivery system.</p>

<p>My solution?  Use both!  With <a href="http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/06/more-ram.html">1.25 GB of RAM</a>, I have the specs to handle it, and the 20” Cinema Display definitely offers the screen real estate.  I only run a few widgets in each application, and it’s not too taxing on my system.</p>

<p>The picture frame widget now integrates <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> photos, and the weather widget provides a link to Yahoo weather and gets its weather information from the <a href="http://www.weather.com/index.html">Weather Channel</a>, which is marginally better than <a href="http://home.accuweather.com/index.asp?partner=accuweather">AccuWeather</a> (I prefer <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a> for accuracy.)</p>

<p>With the availability of the same widgets on both Windows and OS X and the involvement of a new Yahoo dev community, Konfabulator could be well on its way to becoming a new means of grabbing the information that you want, whether it’s from your system or from a feed of your favorite site.</p>

<p>This all leads me to wonder:  What will Google’s answer be?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the first things I do when sitting down at a Windows machine is to switch the appearance to Windows Classic.  The default theme is too unimaginative, and looks like a candy shop.  I do use Windows, especially at school where they use Visual Studio to code.  I like Windows and I know my way around it quite well, but it’s no OS X and I use it as little as possible.  Therefore, the look and feel is quite important to me, even if I’m only using it for a small percentage of the time.</p>

<p>On more than <a href="http://www.auroravisions.com/opendir/blogstuff/ie7googletoolbar.jpg">one</a> <a href="http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/options/prefwindowv/options.png">occasion</a>, I had seen a theme that was strikingly similar to the default Luna theme, but much more professional looking.  It was glassy; more Aquified if you will.  There was only one problem.  I had no idea what the theme was called, and no way to start looking for it.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a>.  Metafilter is a sort of community blog.  Members are allowed to post once a week, and are expected to post to some of the most interesting sites on the web.  The idea is that the community will filter the web so that only the great and interesting things are posted.  AskMeFi is a subset of this community; members can ask any question they like and normally have an answer within a few hours.</p>

<p>I asked the question <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/21875">What theme is this?</a> and had my answer in less than three minutes.  Absolutely amazing.  I even had someone come and comment on <a href="http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/07/googles-improved-home-page.html">my last post</a> to tell me the answer to my question.  Thanks, guys!</p>

<p>It turns out that the theme is called Royale, and it was available through the Windows Media Center edition.  Fortunately, a site had <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml">hosted a ported-to-XP version of the theme</a>.  Later it was found that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=15373C73-D5F6-4AF0-B583-D633CB021612&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft had officially packaged and released the theme</a>, but in order to download the theme, one must go through <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/28/microsoft_genuine_ad.html">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> verification.</p>

<p>The theme is no Aqua, but it’s much better than the Windows Luna default.  It’s glossy and the colors are not quite as loud; in turn, that makes it less obtrusive and easier to use.  This should be the Windows default theme without a doubt.</p>

<p>Thanks again, AskMeFi, for making the view out of the Window just a little bit brighter!</p>
