  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing on my <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=72">endless</a> <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=78">calendar</a> <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=80">fixation</a>, <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> just implemented a todo list to their calendar software.  The bottom line?  It’s awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/140539185/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/140539185_46fa935ca9_o.png" alt="30 Boxes Todo" /></a></p>

<p>You can add todo list items with 30 Boxes’ One Box quick add parsing, and add tags to each item.  A new menu item at the top left of the calendar view lets you quickly see and edit your list.</p>

<p>Drag and drop reordering has been implemented, along with double-click-to-edit and a replaced contextual menu functionality.  If you need to push todo events onto a calendar, the option is right there.  Now, notice that I didn’t say “your calendar” or “the calendar,” because 30B has provided options to post to <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Calendar</a> and <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>Now, just move that drag and drop functionality to the main calendar and let me preface todo items with @todo in the main One Box entry form for even quicker adding, and we can really start Getting Things Done!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZ903Y/sr=8-1/qid=1146784856/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9689860-5192061?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><img src="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/images/album/thursday-a_city_by_the_light_divided_2006.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/">Thursday</a> offered their fourth full-length release to the public.  There is a marked maturity about this album, both in terms of lyrical cohesion and musicality.  The first single, <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Counting+5-4-3-2-1">Counting 5-4-3-2-1</a></em>, is reminiscent of the classic Thursday sound, but contains just the right of experimentation that one could expect from this New Jersey post-hardcore outfit.</p>

<p>While not as mainstream or “poppy” as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/War+All+the+Time">War All The Time</a>, _<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/A+City+by+the+Light+Divided">A City By The Light Divided</a> _is most definitely an evolution for Thursday.</p>

<p>Many of the songs on <em>A City By The Light Divided</em> have an advanced dynamic quality; the songs are long enough to allow for an emotional build and an ebb-and-flow characteristic to shine through.  <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Arc-Lamps%2C+Signal+Flares%2C+A+Shower+Of+White+%28The+Light%29">Arclamps, Signal Flares, A Shower of White (The Light)</a></em>, the album’s instrumental track, and <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Autumn+Leaves+Revisited">Autumn Leaves Revisited</a></em> are perfect examples of this.</p>

<p>The opener to this album could not be more perfect.  Harmonizing such energy and emotion is a hard thing to do in this genre, but the twinkling guitar and eerie sound effects coupled with the macabre lyrics set the mood for the entire album.  Vocalist Geoff Rickly’s inspiration came from a poem by Mexican poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavio_Paz">Octavio Paz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I speak of the immense city, that daily reality comprised of two words: <em>the others.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entire album’s atmosphere and mood is not necessarily the progression that every Thursday fan could have predicted, but it most definitely is a welcome addition to their repertoire and to their reputation as a leader in this  difficult-to-define genre.</p>

<p>Rating: 4/5</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been using <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> for a while now, but I was intrigued at the release of <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>.  The support for GCal in the developer community seems to be much greater than any of the other web-based calendars, which makes sense given Google’s prolific presence in the online world.</p>

<p>I made a post a little while ago that <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=78">described some of my initial impressions of GCal</a>; this post is going to focus on what elements of Google Calendar 30 Boxes needs in order to form an übercalendar.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-support">Third Party Support</h2>

<p>Within GCal’s short lifetime, it has already given life to a <a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/04/18/433/">Firefox extension</a> and a Quicksilver plugin (check your QS prefs to grab it.)  While 30 Boxes seems to have <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/developers/">support for developers</a>, there have not been many results to speak of.  The <a href="http://30boxes.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=1a52a1befee97860c1a9cbb832bb458a">Themes section</a> of their website is sorely lacking, and a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=30%20boxes%20firefox%20extension">Google search for Firefox extensions</a> turns up completely irelevant results.</p>

<p>I want some third party support for 30 Boxes.  It’s an amazing app, but it could definitely benefit from outside help.</p>

<h2 id="access-keys">Access Keys</h2>

<p>Pressing a modifier in order to activate access keys is so 2005.  I love zipping around Gmail and GCal with just a few presses of the keyboard.  Maybe someone could write a Greasemonkey script for this, but the keys need to be default to the app itself.</p>

<h2 id="calendar-views">Calendar Views</h2>

<p>GCal’s Agenda view is pretty nifty, and 30B needs a week and proper day view that is accessible from the main page.  Just having the month view can get pretty stale after a while.  In fact, the 30B interface could stand to take a few lessons from Google.  Sure, GCal is a bit cluttered, but the settings page is way more efficient than the 30B version.</p>

<h2 id="and-vice-versa">… And Vice Versa</h2>

<p>And now that I have lambasted 30B, here are some awesome things that Google needs to implement:</p>

<h4 id="tags">Tags</h4>

<p>This could be the factor that determines whether or not I switch over to GCal.  Google, multiple calendars is cool and all, but we need tags.  Now.</p>

<h4 id="rss-feeds--overlays">RSS Feeds / Overlays</h4>

<p>This is one of my favorite parts of 30B.  I love seeing bookmarks and photos from buddies.</p>

<h4 id="social-aspects">Social Aspects</h4>

<p>30B was built to be a social app from the beginning, and it shows.  The way that buddy calendars overlay onto your own calendar is ingenious.  I haven’t done much with the sharing on GCal, but I know that event invites and additions in 30B is a breeze.</p>

<p>I know that 30B is actively working on implementing new features (and by actively, I mean, can someone tell the 30B guys to get a test server?  This night testing beta feature thing is driving me insane!), and I’m sure that Google is, too.  We as end users can only benefit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In my original post, I wasn’t too impressed with Google Calendar.  I’m back on track now, and I’m ready to write a bit more about this webapp.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>When I first signed up for <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>, I was ready to be impressed.  I already had a <a href="http://30boxes.com">30 Boxes</a> account, so I found the Import tool, and imported my .ics file from 30 Boxes.  For some reason, all the times for all the events were off by 5 hours, which happens to be the offset from GMT that the timezone I live in utilizes.  Pretty fishy, if you ask me.</p>

<p>I tried deleting my calendar to start over, and (this is partially my fault) didn’t realize that deleting your main calendar deleted your account, too.  After much cookie deletion and cache clearing, I finally got into GCal.</p>

<p>I made a new calendar into which I could import my 30 Boxes calendar.  This time around, at the suggestion of a friend, I imported my calendar as a CSV.  The times worked out fine, and I just had to make the few recurring events I had in my calendar start repeating again.</p>

<p>I’m impressed with the speed with the calendar.  I love the multi-day select, and I love the different views of the calendar, in terms of day, week, and month.</p>

<p>Some features reminded me of 30 Boxes; namely the Agenda view and the quick add event box.  However, there are a few things missing, and that’s why I’m sticking with 30 Boxes for now.</p>

<h2 id="tagging">Tagging</h2>

<p>A new Google app that doesn’t have tagging?!  What is going on here?!  I think the idea of multiple calendars is neat and all, but tagging is way more intuitive.  With 30 Boxes, I can make a custom view of any tag, without having to create events in multiple calendars. Sure, the colors thing is neat, but I’d rather have tagging.</p>

<h2 id="quick-add">Quick Add</h2>

<p>Just copy the 30 Boxes method. Seriously.  You can add location, notes, tags, colors, recurring events, or  anything you want from 30 Boxes “One Box.”  You can’t do that with Google’s.  I’m willing to bet that will change, but I can’t wait for that.</p>

<h2 id="calendar-management">Calendar Management</h2>

<p>Really, I just want a mass-delete-all-events-from-main-calendar button, but even a prompt to create a new calendar on import would be nice.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Google’s calendar is a slick app.  Of course, the search is great, and apparently it integrates with Gmail, though I haven’t seen evidence of this yet.  There are some areas that need improvement, so I’ll just stick with 30 Boxes until Google gets the polish out and gives this calendar a once-over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While <a href="http://naked.dustindiaz.com/">the concept</a> is nice, I really hate going to everyone’s blog and not being able to see these wonderful designs that everyone is so proud of.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/news/public200604/1617.htm">Stylegala</a> there is an interesting comment thread about this idea.  Sure, the underlying XHTML is very important.  I even disabled my stylesheets in Firefox and fixed a couple errors in my markup that I wasn’t happy with. One could argue that this is the point of CSS Naked Day, but I don’t see the point in shoving it in every user’s face.</p>

<p>I can’t wait for 6th April, the CSS Renaissance.</p>

<p>Holy #$*&amp;!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">What an awesome move, Apple</a>.</p>

<p>I can only imagine what this does for Apple’s image, both in the home and in the corporate world.</p>

<p>From the Boot Camp page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More and more people are buying and loving Macs. To make this choice simply irresistible, Apple will include technology in the next major release of Mac OS X, Leopard, that lets you install and run the Windows XP operating system on your Mac. Called Boot Camp (for now), you can download a public beta today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It looks like the Gmail Notifier has been fixed.  Who knows what went wrong?  I’m just glad that it’s fixed.</p>

<p>I thought it might have been just me, but <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/">Hawk Wings</a> says that <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/03/29/gmail-notifier-problems/">some people are reporting issues</a> with the latest version of Google’s <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/notifier/index.html">Gmail Notifier</a>.</p>

<p>I’m too busy with school work right now to try and see what’s up with the app, but it seems that the Notifier gets messages very late, and, even after displaying a <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/gmailgrowl/">Growl notification</a>, doesn’t register new mail in the Inbox.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uebercoders.net/gms/">Gmail Status</a> seems to be working fine for now, despite a notice on the developer’s homepage about the latest version always displaying zero unread mails even when there is mail in the Inbox.</p>

<p>Come on Google! First you <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/and-were-back.html">delete your blog</a>, then you go and mess up the Notifier?  What’s going on?!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Am I the only one who thinks that <a href="http://ajaxwrite.com/">AjaxWrite</a> is not only the least impressive Ajax app out there, but one of the worst ideas for a webapp, period? Probably not, but it seems to have generated a <a href="http://technorati.com/search/ajaxwrite">huge amount of buzz</a> recently. <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=551">Alex Russel</a> shares my sentiments, and I’m glad for it.</p>

<p>First of all, yes, it uses Javascript, so technically it can be called an Ajax app, but maybe the acronym should be changed to Asynchronous Javascript and <a href="http://www.xulplanet.com/">XUL</a>.  It requires <em>one, specific version _of</em> one specific browser<em>!  Does that not go against much of the purpose for which Ajax is to be used?  The fact that a webapp that competes with a _ubiquitous Microsoft product</em> doesn’t work in 90% of the browsers on the market speaks volumes.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the webapp sucks.  You have a limited number of layout options, nowhere near enough features ported over from Word to make it a viable competitor, and it’s not intuitive enough from the get-go.  All of the “theory” and the “demonstration of what can be done with Ajax today” only goes so far.  Those benefits don’t hold water in a webapp that replicates what you could do by opening a text editor that comes with nearly every operating system.  I see a need for <a href="http://mail.google.com/">mail that is accessible from anywhere</a> and a <a href="http://30boxes.com/">calendar that can be edited and subscribed to online</a>, but I don’t think a webapp needs to or even <em>can</em> be the saving grace of text editors / word processors.</p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="http://www.ajaxlaunch.com/">AjaxLaunch.com</a> will launch a new Ajax app every week, replicating many PC applications.  Why?  We don’t need watered down versions of Office applications; we need Microsoft to reslease Office 2007 with more of the features we want, and we need projects like <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> to keep the competiton fresh by matching what MS does.  Adding an emasculated word processor to the mix doesn’t make much sense to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> is a great new online calendar that has simply blown me away.  At first I was confused as to what <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/press/">all the fuss was about</a>, but as soon as I started using the calendar, I knew that I had met a tool that would turn even my disorganized self into an all-knowing, event-predicting paragon of preparedness.  <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/01/11/30boxes/">Om Malik said</a> that <em>“30 Boxes will be to calendars what GMail was to EMail.”</em>  I completely agree; the innovative and fresh response to event organization is going to launch this web service and this company into everybody’s lives very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/116043237/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/19/116043237_af9f2259ae_o.png" alt="Theme Changer" /></a></p>

<p>First of all, the default theme was sort of depressing, so I changed it to Gmail blue.  I like that they have new themes already built in.  They have a <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/developers/themes/">theme API</a> that has lots of potential, but I’ve yet to see a gallery of 30 Boxes themes out there.</p>

<h2 id="adding-events">Adding Events</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/116043233/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/40/116043233_d57300500e_o.png" alt="OneBox" /></a></p>

<p>Once I was registered and logged in, adding events seemed as if it would be a daunting task (as it is in most calendars, on or offline,) but as soon as I realized the power of the OneBox, as they call it, I was up to my chest in new events.  “Circuits Homework 3/17 8am repeat weekly” adds an event every week for Circuits Homework.  Of course, you can go to a detailed edit view, and add dates to skip for recurring events.  Notes, tags (which are awesome,) and basically anything else can be added from the OneBox.  <a href="http://30boxes.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=4">There are a few bugs</a>, but at the rate 30 Boxes has been improving over the last month, I have little doubt that those concerns will be addressed.</p>

<h2 id="tags-and-syndication">Tags and Syndication</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/116043234/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/50/116043234_341aee33d0_o.png" alt="Tags" /></a></p>

<p>I mentioned tags just a few moments ago, and I said that they were awesome.  Use “tag <tag name="">&#8221; to specify tags from the OneBox, and off you go.  You can then create custom views based on these tags.  Go tag crazy, and you can have so many calendars of different events that can be viewed instantly.</tag></p>

<p>The syndication features work through tags, too, and I’m impressed.  You can create any number of custom tag calendars from the Settings menu and get RSS feeds and iCal subscriptions till your heart’s content.  Use the menu in the upper left of the main calendar view to highlight specific events on the calendar, or click the magnifying glass to get a popup list of all events tagged with a particular tag. I have, in iCal, my full 30 Boxes calendar along with tagged calendars for homework, projects and tests.  If I want to see <em>just</em> what upcoming projects are due, I can choose to view that calendar in iCal.  30 Boxes also makes a Javascript / HTML badge available, <em>a la</em> <a href="http://del.iciou.us/">del.icio.us</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, which I have added to my <a href="/">front page</a>.  The output is such that you can format it any way you like; I’d look for people to start coming up with creative ways to show off their calendars.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> had a <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/calendar/wget-your-online-calendar-offline-161599.php">recent post</a> about grabbing the  ICS file each morning from the 30 Boxes server in order to use the calendar offline.  While this method doesn’t really appeal to me, with wireless access in the apartment and on campus, I can see this being useful to have before going on trips or otherwise being without online access for an extended period of time.  30 Boxes hasn’t forgotten about the dinosaurs, either, by providing a CVS file for all those Outlook users still out there.</p>

<h2 id="social-networking">Social Networking</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/116189539/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/19/116189539_d0635440d3_o.png" alt="Buddy Views" /></a></p>

<p>The most highly touted feature of 30 Boxes is its integration of buddies.  When I convinced my girlfriend and my dad to finally get accounts, I saw how awesome these features really are.  Buddys’ events are overlayed in a light gray in your own calendar, and can be toggled on or off from the menu in the upper left.  The only feature I miss is the ability to grab a buddy’s RSS feed from their profile.  If 30 Boxes could enable RSS / iCal sharing preferences, this feature would be greatly improved.</p>

<p>Invitations to events are pretty neat, too.  You can add an email address to invite non-30B members to your events, but if you add an email address of a buddy, the event will automatically get added to their calendar.</p>

<p>This calendar has changed the way I organize events.  The fact that I can see others’ events right on top of mine or subscribe to their feeds (after I ask them for the link, of course) is unbelievable.  I have an updated subscription in iCal always open, and my RSS feed in NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>With 30 Boxes now putting new tips under the OneBox for people with more than just a few events (i.e. not newbies), I’m sure I’ll find more and more to like about this calendar.  For instance, you can click a day to get a Day View popup, then click Print to get a nicely formatted version of that day’s events to print out.  Awesome!</p>

<p>This webapp is going to change the way I work and browse the web, just like <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Gmail</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> did.  The pace at which the application is improving is very welcome, and I look forward to the next big thing from 30 Boxen.  Er… Boxes.</p>
