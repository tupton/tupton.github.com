    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> just <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2007/03/today_we_launch.html">announced</a> a new feature set for organizing photos:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/collections/">collections</a>.  Collections are sets of sets or even other collections, up to five levels deep.  This has been a long requested feature, and I’m glad to see that Flickr has finally added this functionality to their great photo organizing app.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> is a still-in-beta photo sharing portal.  I’m sure that everyone has heard of Webshots before, but Flickr is infinitely better.  A Flash-based interface (sometimes annoying but very well done) is used to display individual images, along with a multitude of options with which you can organize.</p>

<p>The best part of the site, however, is the social tagging features.  You can see everyone’s photos (as long as they are marked as public,) and sort through them with tags.  A lot of tags are worth checking out, such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/memorymap/">memory maps</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/transparentdesktop/">transparent desktops</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you can blog about any picture that you are looking at while logged in.  This picture is of Meghan by a creek on her campus, and this post was made on Flickr’s website.  Give it a try.</p>
