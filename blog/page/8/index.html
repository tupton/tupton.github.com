  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Pandora has been redesigned and no longer offers an explicit mini player, so this bookmarklet no longer works as intended.</p>

<p>Continuing in the spirit of all things <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/index.php?s=pandora">Pandora-related</a>, I decided to make a <a href="http://pandora.com">Pandora</a> mini-player pop-up bookmarklet in between classes today.</p>

<p>I just wrote a little Javascript function to open a window, wrapped it in a function, and threw it into a bookmark.  There’s one little annoyance, however: the window opens in the background.  I have no idea how to make windows open in the foreground, so if anyone knows how to make that happen, I’d be grateful if you could let me know.</p>

<p>Without further ado, I give you the Pandora Mini-Player Bookmarklet.
Tested in Firefox 1.5.0.6, Mac OS X 10.4.7.</p>

<p>To use in Firefox:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drag the button below up to your Bookmarks Bar at the top of your Firefox window, below the Address Bar.</li>
  <li>Click the new bookmark to enjoy the Pandora Mini-Player at any time!</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just returned from <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2006/09/flashify_and_wi.html">an amazing Q&amp;A; session</a> with <a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora.com</a> founder Tim Westergren.  Over the course of an hour and half, Tim told the history of his company and what they are doing today, and answered numerous questions from the audience.  The questions varied greatly, from dealing with Pandora’s business model to querying about the technical backend of the Music Genome Project.</p>

<p>The most interesting questions came from people who wanted to know about new features and the future of the service with respect to the end user.  The two greatest features that were discussed were a notification system for when bands tour in your area, and feedback to the user on his or her stored tastes, both from listening habits and the thumbs up / thumbs down ratings that the user has given.  Pandora already has a band-on-tour monitor, so I’m sure it will not be too hard to move that to a location-based tool.  The more exciting feature, in my opinion, is the user feedback from the system itself.</p>

<p>To have feedback on the type of user that Pandora thinks you are, and, more importantly, the ability to tweak this opinion (I’m thinking adjustable sliders of certain prominent music genes, with respect to the interface) would be amazing.  Not only would you get to specify bands and songs that you enjoy, but you would be able to easily tell Pandora what exactly it is about that band or song that you like.</p>

<p>In any case, it was a great presentation from Tim, and I gained a lot of insight to what it takes to see a startup company through good times and rough times.</p>

<p>One last thing:  Tim mentioned to us that there will be a feature overhaul coming in about two weeks’ time.  Be sure to look out for that!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After not posting all summer, I am trying to get some more posts written and posted as soon as possible.  I am going to a <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2006/08/blacksburg_va_t.html">presentation and Q&amp;A;</a> with <a href="http://pandora.com/">Pandora.com</a> founder Tim Westergren tonight; hopefully a post will follow.</p>

<p>I am taking 18 credit hours this semester, but so far I like all my classes, and the workload does not seem like it will become overbearing.  More downtime equals more posting time, so be happy.
Stay tuned for more posts in the near future…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lost may very well be the best thing on television.  24 is the only competition, and I’m happy to watch both.  I’m just sad that they are both over.</p>

<p>The season finale for Lost was the most convoluted, breathtaking, confusing, awesome, amazing, and interesting end to a season that I have ever seen.  Granted, I’m not a big TV buff, but I know what I like, and I like Lost.</p>

<p>I can’t wait until next season.  I’m not going to discuss the show out of respect for those that haven’t seen it, but suffice it to say that now is the perfect time to catch up with both seasons and get prepared (pumped!) for next season.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing on my <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=72">endless</a> <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=78">calendar</a> <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=80">fixation</a>, <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> just implemented a todo list to their calendar software.  The bottom line?  It’s awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/140539185/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/140539185_46fa935ca9_o.png" alt="30 Boxes Todo" /></a></p>

<p>You can add todo list items with 30 Boxes’ One Box quick add parsing, and add tags to each item.  A new menu item at the top left of the calendar view lets you quickly see and edit your list.</p>

<p>Drag and drop reordering has been implemented, along with double-click-to-edit and a replaced contextual menu functionality.  If you need to push todo events onto a calendar, the option is right there.  Now, notice that I didn’t say “your calendar” or “the calendar,” because 30B has provided options to post to <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Calendar</a> and <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>Now, just move that drag and drop functionality to the main calendar and let me preface todo items with @todo in the main One Box entry form for even quicker adding, and we can really start Getting Things Done!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZ903Y/sr=8-1/qid=1146784856/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9689860-5192061?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><img src="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/images/album/thursday-a_city_by_the_light_divided_2006.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/">Thursday</a> offered their fourth full-length release to the public.  There is a marked maturity about this album, both in terms of lyrical cohesion and musicality.  The first single, <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Counting+5-4-3-2-1">Counting 5-4-3-2-1</a></em>, is reminiscent of the classic Thursday sound, but contains just the right of experimentation that one could expect from this New Jersey post-hardcore outfit.</p>

<p>While not as mainstream or “poppy” as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/War+All+the+Time">War All The Time</a>, _<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/A+City+by+the+Light+Divided">A City By The Light Divided</a> _is most definitely an evolution for Thursday.</p>

<p>Many of the songs on <em>A City By The Light Divided</em> have an advanced dynamic quality; the songs are long enough to allow for an emotional build and an ebb-and-flow characteristic to shine through.  <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Arc-Lamps%2C+Signal+Flares%2C+A+Shower+Of+White+%28The+Light%29">Arclamps, Signal Flares, A Shower of White (The Light)</a></em>, the album’s instrumental track, and <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Thursday/_/Autumn+Leaves+Revisited">Autumn Leaves Revisited</a></em> are perfect examples of this.</p>

<p>The opener to this album could not be more perfect.  Harmonizing such energy and emotion is a hard thing to do in this genre, but the twinkling guitar and eerie sound effects coupled with the macabre lyrics set the mood for the entire album.  Vocalist Geoff Rickly’s inspiration came from a poem by Mexican poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavio_Paz">Octavio Paz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I speak of the immense city, that daily reality comprised of two words: <em>the others.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The entire album’s atmosphere and mood is not necessarily the progression that every Thursday fan could have predicted, but it most definitely is a welcome addition to their repertoire and to their reputation as a leader in this  difficult-to-define genre.</p>

<p>Rating: 4/5</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been using <a href="http://30boxes.com/">30 Boxes</a> for a while now, but I was intrigued at the release of <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a>.  The support for GCal in the developer community seems to be much greater than any of the other web-based calendars, which makes sense given Google’s prolific presence in the online world.</p>

<p>I made a post a little while ago that <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=78">described some of my initial impressions of GCal</a>; this post is going to focus on what elements of Google Calendar 30 Boxes needs in order to form an übercalendar.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-support">Third Party Support</h2>

<p>Within GCal’s short lifetime, it has already given life to a <a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/04/18/433/">Firefox extension</a> and a Quicksilver plugin (check your QS prefs to grab it.)  While 30 Boxes seems to have <a href="http://30boxes.com/blog/index.php/developers/">support for developers</a>, there have not been many results to speak of.  The <a href="http://30boxes.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10&amp;sid=1a52a1befee97860c1a9cbb832bb458a">Themes section</a> of their website is sorely lacking, and a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=30%20boxes%20firefox%20extension">Google search for Firefox extensions</a> turns up completely irelevant results.</p>

<p>I want some third party support for 30 Boxes.  It’s an amazing app, but it could definitely benefit from outside help.</p>

<h2 id="access-keys">Access Keys</h2>

<p>Pressing a modifier in order to activate access keys is so 2005.  I love zipping around Gmail and GCal with just a few presses of the keyboard.  Maybe someone could write a Greasemonkey script for this, but the keys need to be default to the app itself.</p>

<h2 id="calendar-views">Calendar Views</h2>

<p>GCal’s Agenda view is pretty nifty, and 30B needs a week and proper day view that is accessible from the main page.  Just having the month view can get pretty stale after a while.  In fact, the 30B interface could stand to take a few lessons from Google.  Sure, GCal is a bit cluttered, but the settings page is way more efficient than the 30B version.</p>

<h2 id="and-vice-versa">… And Vice Versa</h2>

<p>And now that I have lambasted 30B, here are some awesome things that Google needs to implement:</p>

<h4 id="tags">Tags</h4>

<p>This could be the factor that determines whether or not I switch over to GCal.  Google, multiple calendars is cool and all, but we need tags.  Now.</p>

<h4 id="rss-feeds--overlays">RSS Feeds / Overlays</h4>

<p>This is one of my favorite parts of 30B.  I love seeing bookmarks and photos from buddies.</p>

<h4 id="social-aspects">Social Aspects</h4>

<p>30B was built to be a social app from the beginning, and it shows.  The way that buddy calendars overlay onto your own calendar is ingenious.  I haven’t done much with the sharing on GCal, but I know that event invites and additions in 30B is a breeze.</p>

<p>I know that 30B is actively working on implementing new features (and by actively, I mean, can someone tell the 30B guys to get a test server?  This night testing beta feature thing is driving me insane!), and I’m sure that Google is, too.  We as end users can only benefit.</p>
