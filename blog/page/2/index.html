  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7164/6654753833_ab1c242b36_z_d.jpg" alt="Coffee" /></p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTVE5iPMKLg">most of the world</a>, I love coffee. I usually drink a cup or two a day, and sometimes more. I’m lucky enough to live close to places that sell great coffee: Whole Foods roasts their own coffee, and there are numerous local places with great beans.</p>

<p>I usually make a full “batch” of coffee in a French press (or <em>сafetière</em>), but sometimes that’s too much. I know it’s considered blasphemous, but I got a Keurig single cup brewer for Christmas, and I absolutely love it. I was apprehensive about Keurig machines until I found out about refillable “K-Cups” that you could fill with your own, delicious coffee. I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B000DLB2FI">official Keurig “My K-Cup”</a>, but that requires that you replace the entire holster mechanism each time. It’s not time consuming, but it is a bit annoying.</p>

<p>I discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ekobrew-Refillable-Keurig-Brewers-1-Count/dp/B0051SU0OW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1325967276&sr;=8-1">Ekobrew</a>, which is a filter that fits in the existing cup holster. Two of them are on their way to my house from Amazon right now.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it gets there, coffee from the Keurig is (perhaps surprisingly) pleasant. It’s not the best cup of coffee, but it’s quick, easy, and clean.</p>

<p>I still use the French press when I need to make a bigger batch of coffee or if I want to relax and enjoy a really great cup. I use the seemingly-ubiquitous Bodum French press and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0043095WW">burr grinder</a> and keep the coffee warm in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S56U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00004S56U">Zojirushi carafe</a>. Coffee stays <em>hot</em> for hours on end, so I can make coffee in the morning and still enjoy it later in the afternoon. How I make coffee just depends on how much I need and what kind of mood I’m in.</p>

<p>One last thing: I also got a small stovetop espresso maker for Christmas, and it is amazing. When I want a treat, I make myself a café Americano: a bit of espresso in a normal-sized coffee cup and filled the rest of the way with hot water. Yum!</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure</em>: I’ve linked to a number of products on Amazon in this post, and most of them contain my affiliate link. I’ll get a small kickback if anything is bought via these links. I will only ever post links to products that I use and love, and that is certainly the case with everything here. I’m passionate about my coffee, and I don’t want to mislead anyone. I have not included my affiliate link to the Ekobrew refillable K-Cup because I have not received or used it at this time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In light of some <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2011/12/19/my-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-mac-os-x-2011-edition-/">recent</a> <a href="http://collindonnell.com/blog/2012/1/4/essential-tools-2011.html">excellent</a> posts about tools that smart people use, here are my essential tools that I used in 2011.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>I use a 15” MacBook Pro i5 with 8 GB of RAM. It’s quick and does everything I need it to. It’s not <em>too</em> bulky, but it’s certainly bigger than my older 13” MacBook. I keep toying with the idea of a MacBook Air, but I can’t justify the cost and I don’t want to use two machines.</p>

<p>I connect to an Apple LED Cinema Display when I’m at my standing desk, and I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MMY4WY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B002MMY4WY">Logitech wireless keyboard</a> and an Apple Magic Trackpad.</p>

<p>I do <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2011/12/local-backups-are-great/">daily, local backups</a> to a smallish volume on a 1 TB hard drive. The rest of the drive holds my music, photos, and other media.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I do all of my work (both professionally and on this site) on VMs in “the cloud” that I <code>ssh</code> to with <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm 2</a>. I love that it can copy-on-select and the customizable colors are more robust than in other terminal apps. I used the built in Terminal.app for a long time, but the latest iTerm 2 is stable and excellent.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/">HTTP Client</a> to test our API, as well as both Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<p>When I write code, I usually use <a href="http://www.vim.org/"><code>vim</code></a>, but I’ve been testing out the recent alpha builds of <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/">TextMate 2</a>.</p>

<p>When I write for this website or for my own personal notes, I’ve started using <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> to write and preview Markdown. Its fullscreen and “paragraph focus” modes are nice touches. I’ve heard good things about <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, which allows Markdown previews from any app, but I haven’t used it yet.</p>

<p>I’m not a huge calendar user, but I do keep track of <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/events">shows I attend</a> and personal events on Google Calendar. I interact with my calendars with <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>. Its natural language event input is pretty great and lets me add events really quickly.</p>

<p>I work on and use a browser-based email client at work, but I also like to use <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a>. The minimal interface stays out of the way, but all my mail is available quickly. Shortcuts for reply and reply all make it easy to respond to threads. A nice little touch: Sparrow automatically picked up the fact that I had an IMAP folder called Archive in my work email and started using it when I press Delete to archive messages.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> all day every day. My usage statistics say I average 13.6 uses per day, but if you didn’t count weekends, holidays, or days that I don’t actually use my computer, I bet it’d be a lot higher. I <em>love</em> the clipboard management.</p>

<p>I occasionally use <a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">Cloud</a> to quickly upload screenshots, but I don’t use it for much else.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> to manage files, share some music with friends, and back up certain documents. I also store my (encrypted) <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> data on Dropbox so that I can access my passwords from anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://mizage.com/#macdivvy">Divvy</a> and <a href="http://cordlessdog.com/stay/">Stay</a> are two window management tools that I use all the time. When I disconnect from my display, Stay puts my windows back to where I want them. It doesn’t quite work with Chrome, but everything else works well. Divvy lets me resize windows on a custom-sized grid. You can even define shortcuts – I use “c” for a centered window and “6” for a window taking up 60% of the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>I recently started using <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, but I haven’t gotten into it just yet. I’ll have more to write about that when learn how to use it and actually start using it more. I do use <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/clearly.php">Evernote’s Clearly</a> browser extension to read articles on line.</p>

<p>For my musical pleasure throughout the day, I still use iTunes a lot of the time. However, <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> (with <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a>) is usually how I listen to music these days. Airfoil makes it easy to listen to music in my living room via my Apple TV.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently installed <a href="http://shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n">Lessn</a> and then <a href="http://lessnmore.net/">Lessn More</a> to take control of my own short links. Lessn is a very simple URL shortener that is hosted on my own domain.</p>

<p>I registered <a href="http://upton.in/">upton.in</a> to serve my short links. I chose the “.in” TLD because it’s short and common. I do wish there was an “.on” TLD so I could register <em>upt.on</em>, but I like the connotation of “in”. As <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasupton/status/154218836722335745">I said on Twitter the other day</a>, it can mean “Internet, inside, come in, infinity, interesting” among other things. </p>

<p>Lessn also integrates nicely with <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, which I recently started using. I plan to write more on that shortly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Santa brought me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BSC54I/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=thomupto-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B002BSC54I">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a> for Christmas (thanks Mom!). I’ve enjoyed playing it, just as I’ve enjoyed playing video games for nearly my entire life.</p>

<p>In recent years, however, I’ve abandoned or not fully played all of my video games. I attempted to maintain a Google Docs spreadsheet to keep track of my unplayed games, but it quickly became more neglected than the games themselves.</p>

<p>I recently found out about Shaun Inman’s <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2011/04/18/unplayed"><em>Unplayed</em></a>, and it seemed perfect. It’s like a much simpler, lightweight Shelfari for video games. You can now see which games I’m playing (or not playing) at my <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/unplayed/"><em>Unplayed</em> page</a>. For now, I’m going back to Skyloft!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first Christopher Nolan movie I saw was the incredible <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/"><em>Memento</em></a>. I’ve watched it many times since, and I always manage to catch something new. It’s a great movie the first and tenth time you watch it. It’s well-written – with some help from his brother Jonathan, who has helped out on other films since – and the attention to detail is incredible. </p>

<p>I think Nolan caught the attention of most of the movie-going public for his reboot of the Batman franchise. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/"><em>Batman Begins</em></a> is one of the best comic book translations, outdone only by its sequel, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/"><em>The Dark Knight</em></a>. Nolan wisely decided to take breaks between Batman films to make other films that he was interested in. He managed to pull this off because of his own production company, Syncopy Films, and his success as a director. As a result we’ve got two great films so far: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/"><em>The Prestige</em></a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/"><em>Inception</em></a>.</p>

<p>I love that Nolan has focused on other projects that he’s passionate about to avoid creating anything “stale” or boring. I think there’s a larger lesson there that most people can take away. Sometimes you can make something better by <em>not</em> giving it attention.</p>

<p>If Nolan’s “interstitial” movies keep improving at the same rate, we’re in for a treat in 2014.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently started using <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> on OS X and <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> on iOS for my writing in general. Both apps are <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> editors that, in conjunction with Dropbox, let me write from nearly anywhere.</p>

<p>I write my blog posts in Markdown, but the format is useful for almost any kind of writing. Any application that can read plain text can read Markdown for those times that you need to keep it simple, or you can convert to HTML for when you want or need to make it a bit more presentable.</p>

<p>I love using Byword in its fullscreen and paragraph focus view. It’s a great way to minimize distractions with enough context to let you properly proofread your writing. The Markdown to HTML preview is a keyboard shortcut away, and saving to a folder in Dropbox means that I can access my files anywhere.</p>

<p>Elements requires a Dropbox account to work, so I specified the same folder that I save documents from Byword into. Et voilà, I can edit or add to a blog post or any other writing on my iPhone or iPad. Elements has a great Markdown preview, too, and it’s distraction-free (from other apps) by nature of being an iOS app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to make daily backups to my local hard drive. <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2010/12/automated-backups-with-tarsnap/">Remote backup</a> is important, but it’s always nice to have an easily-accessible way to recover from a hard drive disaster, especially when you need to fix the situation <em>quickly</em>.</p>

<h2 id="your-backup-device">Your Backup Device</h2>

<p>Choosing the right hard drive to use for your local backup isn’t a difficult choice, but it is an important one.  Sometimes you can find great deals on good brands (Western Digital or Seagate, to name a couple brands that I have used and liked) on <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">Newegg</a>. The requirements for a hard drive really depend on how you want to use it.</p>

<p>If you want a hard drive dedicated to backup, any drive with a relatively quick speed (I would go with 7200 RPM or higher) and a size that’s at least a bit bigger than the drive you’re backing up will be a great option.</p>

<p>If you want to use a hard drive for other things – to store your media or back up another drive – you’ll obviously need something bigger. I have a 1 TB drive that I have split into two volumes. One volume is a bit bigger than my MacBook Pro’s hard drive (128 GB)  and I use it to hold my backups; the other takes up the rest of the space and is used to store all of my music, movies, and photos.</p>

<p>Solid state drives are another option, but I’ve found that the extra cost isn’t worth the speed benefits. I would absolutely recommend a solid state drive to use in your main computer on a daily basis – I have a 128 GB solid state drive in my MacBook Pro and it’s noticeably faster than the mechanical hard drives I’ve used in MacBooks past. However, when it comes to something like backups, where you’re mostly writing to it in a situation that isn’t time-sensitive (e.g. at night), I think mechanical drives are the best option because you can get much more storage space for much less money.</p>

<h2 id="software-that-helps-you">Software That Helps You</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I use SuperDuper!, but there are many other backup applications out there. Some of them may fit your specific needs better. The key feature is to have an automated and <em>bootable</em> copy of your hard drive ready to go at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>I admittedly have not given Time Machine a fair shot, but that’s because I don’t have a use case for its main draw. “Going back in time” to an earlier version of a file is not something I need to do on a regular basis. And now with Lion’s Versions feature, I don’t need a whole backup just to keep recent versions of my files around.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href="http://www.bombich.com/ccc_features.html">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. It makes bootable backups and can be scheduled to back up on a daily basis. It’s free to try; donations are requested if you continue to use the product.</p>

<p>I love SuperDuper! because it’s so simple. The interface tells you in plain English what is going to happen. I set up my nightly backups one time a couple years ago and the only time I ever see the app again is when I am traveling without my hard drive. When a backup fails, the application stays open to tell you what went wrong. That rarely happens though: usually an incremental backup occurs at 3am that takes less than ten minutes to complete. When it’s done, my data is safe and sound in two places.</p>

<p>The successful backups are bootable, meaning that you can just choose the backup volume as the boot volume when you <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310">hold Option after you turn your computer on</a> and restore from there. If you just want to restore certain files instead of everything, the drive is right there in Finder for you to navigate as usual.</p>

<h2 id="backup-is-not-a-daunting-task">Backup Is Not a Daunting Task</h2>

<p>Almost none of my “non-technical” friends (i.e. friends who do other things in their lives besides fiddle with computers) back up their computers. And yet I know that each one of those friends would be devastated if their hard drive crashed and they lost their music or photos. Local backups are the simplest way to avoid this, and it’s so simple to set up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy a hard drive (7200 RPM and at least as big as the drive you want to back up) and <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=1075">format it using OS X’s built-in Disk Utility</a>.</li>
  <li>Set up a <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">backup application</a> to do daily backups of your entire disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Back up your data. It’s so simple and so useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="a-musical-year">A Musical Year</h2>

<p>Music has been a huge part of my life for a long time now. I started playing the violin in the fourth grade. I played the saxophone for six years, including for four years in my high school marching band. I played in a punk rock band with my best friends from high school for four years. The next and latest chapter of my musical life began when I moved to Austin, TX in June of 2010.</p>

<p>They call Austin the “Live Music Capital of the World”. To many, that sounds like exaggeration and a desperate grasp at something to be proud of. To those who have experienced it, it is almost an understatement. Whether you’ve been punched in the gut in the pit at Emo’s or just seen that gnarly rocker chick band Guilty Pleasures while walking past Thirsty Nickel on a Saturday night, there’s no denying that music is in the blood of Austin. I love it.</p>

<p>2011 was a musical year for me. According to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/TUpton/events/2011">Last.fm</a>, I went to 46 musical events, including SXSW, ACL, and FFFFest. And that doesn’t count the numerous times I caught local acts on the weekends. Some might have thought of 2011 as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10100626303464693&id;=6206637">lackluster</a> year for music, but I disagree. There were some fantastic releases by some great bands; old favorites thanked their fans with fresh material and new (but sometimes only new to me) acts dug their way into my ears and heart.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-medium">A New Medium</h3>

<p>There is something else that affected my music listening habits in 2011: <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a>. I signed up in July and immediately started listening to tons of new music. In November, I listened to at least one new album each day as part of Month of New Music (see my <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thomasupton/status/142345008454959105">#monm playlist</a>.) Rdio tore down any remaining barriers that hindered listening to any music, anywhere, quickly. I chose Rdio over <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a> for a few reasons: Rdio has better social features, better recommendations, a similarly-sized catalogue, better apps on both the desktop and mobile, and a better blog filled with interviews with musicians, reviews, and recommendations.</p>

<p>According to iTunes, I have seventy one albums that were released in 2011. This is lower than any other year that I have been adding music to iTunes, but that is explained by my prolific use of Rdio. I have purchased a few albums after streaming them, but Rdio is almost like having a second library. I briefly looked for statistics on Rdio listening habits, but I couldn’t find any. Believe me when I say I listen to a ton of music every day while working.</p>

<p>I made a list of nineteen albums that were my favorites of the year. I’ve pared it down to ten that I want to talk about, but I’ll mention the others at the end. All in all, it was a great year of music for me.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="running-from-a-gamble-by-company-of-thieves">Running From a Gamble by Company of Thieves</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/company-of-thieves-running-from-a-gamble.jpg" alt="Running From a Gamble by Company of Thieves" /></p>

<p>Genevieve Schatz can sing. She has a huge voice, especially for such a small, unassuming person. She’s backed by a band that can simultaneously rock out and complement her vocals. This is a poppy album, but it’s filled with soul <em>and</em> rock. The first song I heard from <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUCYo"><em>Running from a Gamble</em></a> was the incredible “Death of Communication.” From a simple beginning, it quickly builds into a spunky anthem. The outro to that song leaves you wanting more, and more is what you get on <em>Gamble</em>. Every song has character, with lots of soul and even blues influences. See this band live and stand in awe.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="barton-hollow-by-the-civil-wars">Barton Hollow by The Civil Wars</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/the-civil-wars-barton-hollow.jpg" alt="Barton Hollow by The Civil Wars" /></p>

<p>If you had asked me five years ago if I would ever pick a folk or country-influenced album to put on my list of favorites from the past year, I would have laughed. Then I heard <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJRNEE"><em>Barton Hollow</em></a>.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a silly and meaningless (to everyone but me) story, but I’ll recount it anyway. I was at a friend’s house for a party over the summer. I had traveled halfway across the country to go, so I was staying over and was the only one left the next day. I have a tradition to trade music with this friend whenever we meet up, so he gave me a number of albums and told me to check one or two of them out while he went to take care of some errands. I just picked <em>Barton Hollow</em> by chance. I put it on and laid down on the bed and just stared at the ceiling and listened to the entire album. It’s so calming and soothing, and it was perfect for that moment.</p>

<p>I’ve since listened to this album many times. Both members of this band can sing incredibly well, and their song-writing and story-telling skills are second to none. The vocals are certainly the focal point of The Civil Wars’ music, but the guitar picking and occasional percussion are nothing to scoff at. This is beautiful music.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-king-of-limbs-by-radiohead">The King of Limbs by Radiohead</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/radiohead-the-king-of-limbs.jpg" alt="The King of Limbs by Radiohead" /></p>

<p>I’ll never understand why <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJSzO0"><em>The King of Limbs</em></a> was poorly received by both critics and fans alike. I tend not to compare Radiohead releases to each other — <em>Kid A</em> is one of my favorite albums, but it doesn’t mean I like it any <em>better</em> than <em>OK Computer</em> or <em>Hail to the Thief</em>, it just means that I enjoy it for what it is and how it makes me feel in comparison to other albums that are not made my crazy Englishmen.</p>

<p>Radiohead is definitely a band all about feel. <em>Limbs</em> seems to have more of an electronic feel to it. There are little “glitches” on the tracks, the percussion is so precise that it’s almost robotic, and synths are prevalent. Radiohead has always had hints of this kind of thing since early on, but it’s out in the open here.</p>

<p>The band released a set of remixes of the album throughout the year, and they actually serve to show how great the album is: each one of these songs can and is interpreted in a number of ways.</p>

<p>I love the muted guitar on “Morning Mr Magpie” and the haunting lyrics of the aptly-named “Give Up The Ghost”. If nothing else, <em>Limbs</em> has made me look forward to where Radiohead takes us next. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="weightless-by-animals-as-leaders">Weightless by Animals as Leaders</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/animals-as-leaders-weightless.jpg" alt="Weightless by Animals as Leaders" /></p>

<p>Two eight-string guitarists and one insane drummer — it’s such an unusual lineup, and Animals as Leaders is an unusual band. Started as a bit of a side or solo project by lead guitarist Tosin Abasi, his debut album featured just one man and programmed drums, but it laid the groundwork for a technical metal act like no other. After recruiting some bandmates, Animals went on tour and proceeded to melt the faces of anyone who got close.</p>

<p><a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJQT-Y"><em>Weightless</em></a> takes the concepts explored on the debut — polyrhythms, syncopated percussion, quickly sweeping arpeggios — and multiplies everything by ten. Thousand. It’s heavier, more chaotic, and tighter than ever.</p>

<p>This is another band to see live. They somehow still have stage presence despite the lack of a proper frontman and vocals, and Abasi seems to take genuine pleasure in blowing minds with his music. Percussionist Navene Koperweis manages to keep up with both the twisted programmed beats of old and with his own work on <em>Weightless</em>. It is certainly a feat to play something that someone else wrote with a computer; it’s something else entirely to continue to write new material in the same style.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="burst-apart-by-the-antlers">Burst Apart by The Antlers</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/the-antlers-burst-apart.jpg" alt="Burst Apart by The Antlers" /></p>

<p>My immediate reaction to “I Don’t Want Love” was “this is a lighter direction for The Antlers than <em>Hospice</em>.” Peter Silberman’s lyrics weren’t much (or even any) happier, but the music was lighter, more melodic, and a little poppier. There’s more rock influence throughout this record than on <em>Hospice.</em> In fact, there’s more, period. Every song is meatier. While some may say that the sparseness of <em>Hospice</em> was one of its key elements, the full-bodied, well-crafted songs of <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUYlE"><em>Burst Apart</em></a> are even more essential to bringing The Antlers to life.</p>

<p>The main contributors to this full sound are Michael Lerner’s focused percussion and the addition of layered guitar work, provided live by Timothy Mislock. The riffs in Parentheses are a definite stand-out. Both on the stage and in the studio, one can see the passion behind the music. I’ve been lucky enough to catch The Antlers live a number of times, and each show is better than the last, with more energy than they could capture on the record. I’ve seen them on the intimate Parish stage, and I’ve seen them on the giant AMD stage at ACL. No matter the setting, these guys play their hearts out.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="father-son-holy-ghost-by-girls">Father, Son, Holy Ghost by Girls</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/girls-father-son-holy-ghost.jpg" alt="Father, Son, Holy Ghost by Girls" /></p>

<p>Once <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJRUZQ"><em>Father, Son, Holy Ghost</em></a> gets going (which is right away), Girls start rocking. There’s a bit of Spoon influence on the opening track, and a bit of Wilco throughout, but Girls manage to carve out their own rock niche here. “Die” really puts the pedal to the metal, and crowd-favorite “Vomit” has an incredibly catchy melody.</p>

<p>I admittedly know very little about Girls. I saw that they were recommended to me on Rdio, and I couldn’t stop listening to the album. I saw them live at Fun Fun Fun Fest, and they were amazing, but the record is where they really shine. It’s the sort of rock that doesn’t really stand out from the crowd too much until you realize that you’ve stopped doing whatever else it was you were doing while listening and your undivided attention is given to the music.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="little-hell-by-city-and-colour">Little Hell by City and Colour</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/city-and-colour-little-hell.jpg" alt="Little Hell by City and Colour" /></p>

<p>With the addition of percussion and backup guitars to nearly every song, Dallas Green has fleshed out his solo project to a full-fledged folk act. His lyrics are still tragic and romantic, but now they have more meat behind them.</p>

<p>I must have listened to <em>Bring Me Your Love</em> two hundred times. I haven’t listened to <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJUrgI"><em>Little Hell</em></a> that much just yet, but I know I will. I can’t exactly pinpoint why, but this music is inherently re-playable. It never gets old. I usually chalk it up to Green’s incredible story-telling ability and pleasant accompaniment, but no matter how you try to explain it, this is great stuff.</p>

<p>Prepare to be saddened, but also prepare to leave what you’re doing and enter Green’s lyrical world.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="no-devolucin-by-thursday">No Devolución by Thursday</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/thursday-no-devolucion.jpg" alt="No Devolución by Thursday" title="No Devolución" /></p>

<p>Thursday turned a furious corner with 2006’s <em>A City by the Light Divided</em> and hasn’t looked back. <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJV4mU"><em>No Devolución</em></a> is the ultimate manifestation of the post rock-influenced dynamic that was only hinted at on their previous two efforts. There is an almost monstrous quality to some of the tracks on <em>No Devolución</em>: “Past and Future Ruins” is chaotic and grandiose all at once. The percussion through the entire album is forceful: the drums drive and the bass pulses. Ghastly yells are next to quiet, almost croaked vocals.</p>

<p>Geoff Rickly’s lyrics have always been somewhat enigmatic, and that is no different here. There are moments of poignancy — “I lost my wedding ring / down the kitchen sink” — but there are still some puzzlers — “There’s a thousand black cars / driving around in my blood stream.”</p>

<p><em>No Devolución</em> is Thursday’s magnum opus in a literal sense of the phrase. It is great, and it is the sum of all the passion that these guys have for music; a true work of the heart. It is sad that Thursday has <a href="http://thursday.net/thank-you">decided step down off of the stage</a>, but we can all be thankful for what they left us with.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="garden-window-by-obrother">Garden Window by O’Brother</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/garden-window-o-brother.jpg" alt="Garden Window by O'Brother" /></p>

<p>Huge. Everything about Garden Window is full, monolithic, and <em>epic</em>. I first heard O’Brother live in August at Emo’s inside. Even there on that puny stage, they had a wall-of-sound presence that couldn’t be ignored. I saw them a couple of months later at the new Emo’s East, and they were even tighter and bigger sounding. Needless to say, I was excited about the release of their LP, <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJP-oU"><em>Garden Window</em></a>.</p>

<p>Every song on the album is meaningful — there is no filler. There are some lengthy songs here — crowd favorite “Poison!” clocks in at nearly eight minutes, and “Cleanse Me” is fourteen minutes long — but <em>Garden Window</em> never drags. Quite the opposite: each song is filled with so much building tension and dynamic that it feels like you’re going to explode with each listen. It’s hard to put O’Brother into a single category or genre, but it’s very heavy at its heaviest and it’s always unrelenting. This is post-rock for those who like their coffee strong and black.</p>

<p>I highly recommend seeing O’Brother live, in case that wasn’t obvious. They do a great job of capturing their sound on record, but it’s one thing to rock out to <em>Garden Window</em> with your headphones on at your desk and another thing entirely to hear the bass drone through a song with a cello bow while eye-bulging screams are heard over a wall of guitars and drums.</p>

<h2 id="majorminor-by-thrice">Major/Minor by Thrice</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/2011/thrice-major-minor.jpg" alt="Major/Minor by Thrice" /></p>

<p>Thrice has delivered great musical experiences for over ten years. They have taken a curvy road to the release of <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVhGxyJQWhk"><em>Major/Minor</em></a>, but it’s been an enjoyable journey every step of the way.</p>

<p><em>Major/Minor</em> is the most natural and expected follow-up to any album in Thrice’s discography. It builds on <em>Beggars’</em> grooviness but adds a lot more punch and poignancy. Every riff is carefully crafted, every beat brings you into the song. Every song is killer.</p>

<p>Thrice could not have <a href="http://www.thrice.net/post/13115093663/an-announcement-from-dustin">ended their musical career</a> on a higher note. The band could never put out any material that disappointed me, but I think this surpasses even harsh critics’ expectations. Let’s face it though: who’s a harsh critic of Thrice?</p>

<p>The first song I heard was the lead single and album opener, “Yellow Belly”. Its bluesy riff motif is echoed throughout the track, and right from the get-go we can feel that this is Thrice at their best. Other standout tracks include “Call It In The Air”, “Words In The Water”, and “Disarmed”, but there isn’t any filler here.</p>

<p>I was heartbroken to hear that Thrice was taking a break shortly after ending the tour that supported the release of <em>Major/Minor</em>. Thankfully I was able to see them live one last time. I know that every member of the band reached that decision after much contention. I’ve heard rumors that brothers Riley and Ed Breckenridge are working on something together, Dustin Kensrue remains the music worship leader at his church in Orange County, and I know that Teppei Teranishi cannot stay away from making music from long. I’m interested in hearing the direction that each of these guys go after being part of such a great band for so long.</p>

<hr />

<p>Like I said earlier, I picked out nineteen total albums this year. Here are the “honorable mentions,” so to speak, with a little bit about what I loved about them.</p>

<h4 id="mastodon---the-hunter">Mastodon - The Hunter</h4>

<p>Less “out-there” than <em>Crack the Skye</em>, it has some of the most poppy songs Mastodon has ever written, but all the face-melting is still there.</p>

<h4 id="man-man---life-fantastic">Man Man - Life Fantastic</h4>

<p>Incredible live act; the song writing just keeps getting better (and more sincere).</p>

<h4 id="neon-indian---era-extraa">Neon Indian - Era Extraña</h4>

<p>I only just found out about this band. It’s great music for chilling out or working to.</p>

<h4 id="fleet-foxes---helplessness-blues">Fleet Foxes - Helplessness Blues</h4>

<p>Vocal heaven. There are so many instruments and layers going on here. This is gorgeous, sleepy music.</p>

<h4 id="mister-heavenly---out-of-love">Mister Heavenly - Out of Love</h4>

<p>“Doom wop” is such a hilariously accurate term, and I can’t wait to hear more from these guys if they keep it going.</p>

<h4 id="august-burns-red---leveler">August Burns Red - Leveler</h4>

<p>These guys keep getting better and better. I don’t know how, but they outdid <em>Constellations</em> here. “Internal Cannon” is a standout track with its salsa breakdown — that’s not a typo.</p>

<h4 id="florence--the-machine---ceremonials">Florence + The Machine - Ceremonials</h4>

<p>A lot more serious this time around, but more heart and passion. I’d love to see this act live.</p>

<h4 id="childish-gambino---camp">Childish Gambino - Camp</h4>

<p>A lot of people dismiss Donald Glover as another actor-wannabe-rapper, but he’s got the chops. So many great beats and awesome, meaningful lyrics here.</p>

<h4 id="cloudkicker---let-yourself-be-huge">Cloudkicker - Let Yourself Be Huge</h4>

<p>It took a lot for me not to include this on my list of ten favorites. The closing track is amazing. The whole album is such a departure from other Cloudkicker material, and I’m curious to see where it goes next. Highly recommended.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lot of my picks centered around bands that I have also seen live this year. There’s something visceral about watching a band make music right in front of you. Whether you’re hearing a new act live for the first time or you’re enjoying live renditions of some of your old favorites, there’s something to be said for experiencing that beauty up close and personal.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my picks. Please let me know what you think and what your favorite music of 2011 is.</p>
