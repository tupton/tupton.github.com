  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2006-09-13-encrypted-backup.html">reading</a> <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2008-11-10-tarsnap-public-beta.html">about</a> <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a> a couple of years ago, back when it was only an idea. I wasn’t too convinced about using a service that was in beta to back up my data, but I recently rediscovered that it had graduated to a full-blown product and signed up immediately.</p>

<p>Tarsnap is an encrypted backup tool based on archives. I’m not going to go into any details about the implementation, but you can read about the <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html">cryptography</a>, <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/security.html">the security</a>, or anything else about the <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/design.html">overall design</a> of the tool on the <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap site</a>. Basically, it creates archives (hence the “tar” part of the name), encrypts them, and stores them on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. The “snap” part of the name refers to the idea that backups are done in “snapshots,” which means that backups are incremental and duplicate data can be shared between archives.</p>

<p>After you sign up for a Tarsnap account, put at least $5 (via Paypal) into your account, and <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/man-tarsnap-keygen.1.html">generate a key</a>, you can begin backing up your data. You can read more about <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/gettingstarted.html">getting started</a> and <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/usage.html">using <code>tarsnap</code> in general</a>, but I really want to talk about automated backups with Tarsnap.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-wrapper">A Simple Wrapper</h2>

<p>I found <a href="http://jonathanstreet.com/blog/setting-up-backups-with-tarsnap">a blog post by Jonathan Street</a> that detailed his automated backups, and that served as inspiration for my system. I wrote a little bash script to wrap <code>tarsnap</code> for my purposes:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="c">#! /bin/bash</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="sb">`</span>date +%F<span class="se">\ </span>%T<span class="sb">`</span>: Beginning back up of <span class="nv">$2</span>
</span><span class="line">/usr/local/bin/tarsnap -c -f <span class="nv">$1</span>-<span class="sb">`</span>date +%F<span class="sb">`</span> <span class="nv">$2</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="sb">`</span>date +%F<span class="se">\ </span>%T<span class="sb">`</span>: Completed back up of <span class="nv">$2</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Calling <code>tarsnap-backup.sh  </code> tells tarsnap to create an archive  of the specified directory with the given name and the current date. I was in business.</p>

<h3 id="generating-a-new-key">Generating a new key</h3>

<p>An aside: Jonathan Street’s blog post mentioned creating a new key that only had permission to read and write archives. I initially did the same thing, but for reasons I’ll get into later, I wanted the ability to delete backups, too. Generating a new key was extremely easy:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nv">$ </span>tarsnap-keymgmt --outkeyfile /root/tarsnap-rw.key -r -w /root/tarsnap.key
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>This creates a new key in <code>/root/</code> called <code>tarsnap-rw.key</code> that only has read and write permission.</p>

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

<h3 id="newsyslog"><code>newsyslog</code></h3>

<p>The simple wrapper script above was great, but if I was going to automate it, I needed those <code>echo</code> statements to go to a more permanent log file. If I was going to do daily backups of directories, I needed some sort of log management. After searching around a bit, it became clear that <code>newsyslog</code> was the way to go on OS X. Looking at the file in <code>/etc/newsyslog.conf</code> was enough to give me the basic file structure, but the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newsyslog&sektion;=8">man pages</a> go into a lot of detail.</p>

<p>I made a configuration called <code>user.conf</code> in <code>/etc/newsyslog.d/</code> and put my tarsnap logs inside. I decided to use a distinct log for each automated backup I do, as opposed to a single tarsnap log. I still haven’t decided if this is the right way to go, but I do like being able to quickly see the result of the last backup. My <code>user.conf</code> looks like the following.</p>

<pre><code>/var/log/tarsnap-backup-code.log                        640     5       1000    *       Z
/var/log/tarsnap-backup-documents.log                   640     5       1000    *       Z
</code></pre>

<p>This configuration tells <code>newsyslog</code> to gzip, roll to a new log once the current log exceeds 1MB in size, and keep at most five old logs.</p>

<h3 id="cron"><code>cron</code></h3>

<p>With log rotation in place, I could create a cron job.</p>

<pre><code>0 4 * * * /usr/local/bin/tarsnap-backup code ~/code &gt; /var/log/tarsnap-backup-code.log
</code></pre>

<p>This crontab schedules backups for my <code>code</code> directory at 4am daily and my <code>Documents</code> directory at 5am daily. I used <code>sudo crontabe -e</code> to create this because both <code>tarsnap</code> and my log file’s permissions require root privileges. This would have sufficed, but there was a nagging thought in the back of my head: I <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/blog/2009/09/i-love-weather/">knew</a> that <code>launchd</code> is used in place of <code>cron</code> in OS X, and I thought this would give me a good opportunity to dive into even more options that <code>launchd</code> has to offer.</p>

<h3 id="launchd"><code>launchd</code></h3>

<p>Since I wanted these backups to run whenever possible, I decided to put my <code>launchd</code> backup configurations in <code>/Library/LaunchDameons</code> instead of <code>/Library/LaunchAgents</code>. LaunchDaemons are able to run without a logged-in user; this is exactly what I wanted. The <code>launchd</code> configuration for my <code>code</code> backup looks like the following:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The <code>ProgramArguments</code> section is exactly how I called the backup script from <code>cron</code>. The <code>UserName</code> and <code>GroupName</code> keys are important: they tell <code>launchd</code> to run the backup script as root, which, as I mentioned before, is necessary for using <code>tarsnap</code> and for appending to the log file. The <code>StandardErrorPath</code> and <code>StandardOutPath</code> keys tell <code>launchd</code> to redirect output to the proper log file. The <code>StartCalendarInterval</code> tells <code>launchd</code> to run this script at 5am daily.</p>

<p>After registering the configuration via <code>launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.thomasupton.backup-daily-documents.plist</code>, my automated backup system was in place.</p>

<h2 id="backup-management">Backup Management</h2>

<p>Since Tarsnap backs up data with the notion of “snapshots” and keeps track of blocks of data (and not archive data), keeping multiple archives of the same data doesn’t make much sense. However, running a daily backup by creating a new archive would mean that many archives would build up fast. I decided that keeping at most three previous backups of the same data would suffice. I wanted to automate this, too. This is the reason I decided not to use a read-write-only key.</p>

<p>I added the following lines to my <code>tarsnap-backup.sh</code> script.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="c"># Remove the backup from three days previous, if there is one</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="sb">`</span>date +%F<span class="se">\ </span>%T<span class="sb">`</span>: Removing backup of <span class="nv">$2</span> from <span class="sb">`</span>date -v-3d +%F<span class="sb">`</span>
</span><span class="line">/usr/local/bin/tarsnap -d -f <span class="nv">$1</span>-<span class="sb">`</span>date -v-3d +%F<span class="sb">`</span>
</span><span class="line"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="sb">`</span>date +%F<span class="se">\ </span>%T<span class="sb">`</span>: Completed removing backup of <span class="nv">$2</span> from <span class="sb">`</span>date -v-3d +%F<span class="sb">`</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The key to this is the date in the archive name passed to <code>tarsnap -d</code>. <code>date -v</code> lets you add a value to the date output, so <code>-v-3d</code> outputs the date from three days previous. Now, every scheduled backup attempts to delete the archive from three days ago in addition to creating a backup for the current day. Of course, if a backup is missed, this can lead to an accumulation of old archives. This is where the log files come in handy: I can just inspect the logs every couple of days to see what successfully ran and manually prune the archive list if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="large-backups">Large Backups</h3>

<p>I said “if a backup is missed,” but I didn’t mention why that might occur. The answer becomes apparent when you start talking about backing up large amounts of data. My <code>~/Documents</code> folder was over 12GB, and with my terrible upload speeds, that would mean that it would take a long, long time to upload everything. Even though I was able to prune the contents of <code>~/Documents</code> down to 6.5GB, I still needed more than an hour to back it up. <code>tarsnap</code> doesn’t perform more than one archive transaction at once, so if the <code>documents</code> archive was still running when the <code>code</code> archive process began, tarsnap would cancel the latter and continue with the former, hence a backup is missed. This is also another reason that I decided to keep separate log files for each backup job. The log lines for an in-progress job aren’t interspersed with a failed attempt to start another backup job.</p>

<p>The <code>documents</code> backup was still too large to have been done by the morning, and I didn’t really want to sacrifice my network connection just for the sake of a backup. Fortunately, <code>tarsnap</code> supports archive truncation. According to the <a href="http://www.tarsnap.com/man-tarsnap.1.html">man pages</a>, <code>tarsnap</code> responds to the <code>SIGQUIT</code> interrupt by truncating the archive and appending “<code>.part</code>” to the archive name. When my large backup job was still running, all I had to do was send the <code>SIGQUIT</code> signal with <code>kill -3</code> (alternatively, you could send <code>^Q</code> if you use <code>tarsnap</code> from a console and not from a scheduled job) and <code>tarsnap</code> would effectively “pause” the backup. The next time that same data is archived, <code>tarsnap</code> will recognize it and only upload new data. This works even with a different archive name, thanks to snapshots and block data.</p>

<h2 id="restoring-backups">Restoring Backups</h2>

<p>Tarsnap is a great service, but truly for those who know what they are doing. It took me far longer than I would like to admit to come up with a process for all of this, but it was worth it. Of course, creating backups is only one part of a complete system. The other, more important part, is restoration. Since <code>tarsnap</code> is built on <code>tar</code> and <code>libarchive</code>, this is incredibly simple. <code>tarsnap -x</code> extracts archives, and <code>tarsnap -r</code> writes a tar stream to <code>stdout</code>, which can be used to create a local tar.</p>

<p>If you like the idea of easy, encrypted backups, tarsnap is a great service. It’s cheap, secure, and reliable, plus it’s fun and easy to use if you’re comfortable with UNIX-style archiving tools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin.com</a> is a utility for sharing snippets of text with anyone. The service is simple: go to <a href="http://pastebin.com/">pastebin.com</a>, paste your text, click submit, and share the link. It’s useful for sharing time-saving snippets with you team, or for an impromptu, informal code review of changes that for one reason or another haven’t been committed yet (e.g. a design decision for which the author wants early feedback.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>10:56:55 AM</em> <strong>Mike Bulman</strong>: im gonna try to find one, but if it doesn’t exist im gonna write:  a service/app for osx that will post whatevers on the clipboard to pastebin and give you a url</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple of days ago, my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mikebulman">Mike</a> suggested that he wanted a utility that would make it easy to post to pastebin without having to break your workflow and go to the site. I thought “that sounds fun,” and went to work that evening.</p>

<p>Pastebin has a <a href="http://pastebin.com/api.php">simple RPC API</a> for posting content, and it’s perfect for <code>curl</code>. The very first version of the pastebin script was this simple <code>curl</code> script.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env bash</span>
</span><span class="line">curl -s -X POST -d <span class="s2">&quot;paste_code=$1&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;http://pastebin.com/api_public.php&quot;</span> | pbcopy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p><code>paste_code</code> is the POST parameter that the pastebin API expects to contain pasted content, so we just POST that to the public API page. The output of a successful pastebin API call is the URL for the paste, so we pipe that to OS X’s clipboard for easy pasting. Right from the beginning, this is clearly an OS X-specific script, but I don’t think it would be that hard to interact with the Linux system clipboard via <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>Making this work for text from <code>stdin</code> instead of as an argument was easy, too.</p>

<p>Both Mike and I recently started using <a href="http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/">Jumpcut</a>, a minimal clipboard manager for OS X, so I had the idea of copying the actual text that was posted to pastebin before copying the URL so both would be readily available via Jumpcut. I tried adding <code>echo "$to_paste" | pbcopy</code> before the <code>curl</code> call, but it didn’t always work. I didn’t actually find any documentation on it, but it seems that <code>pbcopy</code> does some sort of buffering so that too much text isn’t copied in quick succession. Adding a very hacky <code>sleep</code> call fixed it, so the resulting script became the following.</p>

<p>Having a commandline script is all well and good, but it’s on about the same usability level as using pastebin.com: instead of switching to a browser, you switch to a terminal, but you still have to paste content and get away from you original context. This is where OS X Services come into play.</p>

<p>The OS X Service menu is often neglected, but it’s very useful. There are some neat built-in services, like looking a word up in Dictionary or composing a new email with the selection. With tools like  <a href="http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/">Automator</a> or <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/">ThisService</a>, creating your own service is easy. I created an Automator workflow that assumed the script was symbolically linked to <code>/usr/local/bin/pastebin</code> and called the script. You can easily add a keyboard shortcut to a Service in the System Preferences Keyboard Shortcuts preference pane.</p>

<p>I cleaned up the script by adding a few command line options using the <code>getopts</code> <code>bash</code> built-in. This was pretty useful and easy to use. I’m not a very proficient <code>bash</code> scripter, but I was easily able to add what I needed, including making the ability to copy the text optional and allowing a file to be used in place of <code>stdin</code>. <a href="http://ginatrapani.org/">Gina Trapani</a>’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli">todo.txt</a> script was helpful in figuring out the correct syntax.</p>

<p>I wrapped the script and the Automator workflow and <a href="https://github.com/tupton/pastebin-cl/">added it to github</a>. You can <a href="https://github.com/tupton/pastebin-cl/blob/8ff3cdda9e0027c41416b285f2822781a0ba4b5e/pastebin.sh">view the original bash script</a> in its latest form if you’re interested.</p>

<p>All this was well and good, but a couple of things bothered me. I didn’t like that <code>sleep</code> call, and I knew that the pastebin API offered a few options that I wasn’t allowing users of this script to take advantage of. So I did what any normal developer would do: I rewrote the script in python. The <a href="https://github.com/tupton/pastebin-cl/blob/d462c57542e98f23c83dc6388e1e5ebbafe04c94/pastebin.py">original version of the script</a> was just a straight “port” of the <code>bash</code> script, but I had plans for more.</p>

<p>I have experience with <a href="https://github.com/tupton/python-yahoo-weather">simple python scripts</a>, but I decided I should try my luck using classes in order to wrap the pastebin API. It was really easy. The beginning of the class looked like the following.</p>

<p>Then all I had to do was use the class.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

<p>I have no idea if getters and setters are very “pythonic,” but they make sense to me, even if I’m only using them internally for this script. I used a pretty interesting trick to build the POST data string. I put the necessary data into a dictionary, but I needed to build a proper parameter string.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="python"><span class="line"><span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">k</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot;=&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">iteritems</span><span class="p">()])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I love the syntax used for “inline” for-loops here. The extra <code>str()</code> call was used just in case a parameter (like expiration date) was accidentally interpreted as a number.</p>

<p>I updated the <a href="https://github.com/tupton/pastebin-cl/blob/master/README.md">README</a> to reflect the new options. Thankfully, only the symbolic link to <code>/usr/local/bin/pastebin</code> had to be updated in order to keep the workflow working. Using the pastebin script couldn’t be easier:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tupton/pastebin-cl/archives/master">Download the script source</a>, extract it, and put it somewhere that makes sense, like <code>~/scripts</code>.</li>
  <li><code>ln -s ~/scripts/pastebin-cl/pastebin.py /usr/local/bin/pastebin</code></li>
  <li>Open the workflow in <code>automator/Paste to pastebin.com.workflow</code> and save it as a service, which should just be as easy as ⌘-S.</li>
  <li>Open System Preferences &gt; Keyboard, then Keyboard Shortcuts, then Services. Make sure that the “Paste to pastebin.com” service is checked. Optionally, you can give it a keyboard shortcut.</li>
  <li>Highlight some text in any OS X application and choose “Paste to pastebin.com” from the application menu’s “Services” submenu or use your keyboard shortcut. Now the pastebin URL is on you clipboard, ready to be pasted into a chat room or in a browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this script will be useful to developers all over. If you have any ideas about making this more portable (i.e. for use on Linux or Windows), let me know in the <a href="#respond">comments</a>.</p>

<p>Countless times, I have come across a piece of <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/New%20Yorker">long-form writing</a> that I just don’t have time to read at that moment. I used to just keep the link in question open in a tab for days and never actually get around to reading it. Sometimes I would <a href="http://delicious.com/third">bookmark it using Delicious</a>, which helped me get back to the site with the article but did nothing to encourage me to read.</p>

<p>I recently started using <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>, a neat service from <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> that helps one save articles and other web pages for reading later. In addition to bookmarking articles with the incredibly simple Read Later bookmarklet, Instapaper can extract text from articles and remove cruft like navigation and ads from the content you’re interested in. These tools are available on the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/extras">Instapaper Extras</a> page. Now, with a simple click, articles are saved to a list where you can easily access either the original site or just the article text.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of other helpful extras, too. Kindle users can download a compatible file that contains their articles, complete with sections and a table of contents. There are tons of apps with Instapaper support for OS X, Windows, iOS, and Android. I use the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8">Instapaper iOS</a> app on both my iPad and my iPhone. It’s great for catching up on my reading while traveling without an internet connection. The latest version offers a great progress indicator and the ability to <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/1538890633">automatically switch to dark mode</a> based on the sunset times in your location.</p>

<p>Instapaper offers cool options for people who publish content, too. There’s a <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/bodytext">public settings page</a> for the text parser so people can tweak how Instapaper extracts text from articles on sites that have lots of ads or extraneous content. Publishers can <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/publishers">explicitly tell Instapaper which elements to use</a> as the title and text by adding <code>instapaper_title</code> and <code>instapaper_body</code> classes to those elements, respectively. I have added the appropriate classes to articles on this site.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/instapaper-blog.png" alt="Instapaper on Uptonian Thoughts" /></p>

<p>There’s also a “Read Later” button that I have added to each of the articles on this site. If you’re logged in to Instapaper, you can quickly save the current article with just one click.</p>

<p>Marco Arment <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/">actively updates and writes about the Instapaper service</a>, and I look forward to seeing what’s to come for this excellent tool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suck at writing, and I suck even more at writing often.</p>

<p>Here’s the rest of the list of my favorite music from 2009:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number four</em>: <strong>The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/between-the-buried-and-me_the-great-misdirect_2009.jpg" alt="The Great Misdirect by Between The Buried And Me" /></p>

<p>Incredible work from the always-reliable technical metal group. This is an album for serious guitar and bass aficionados; the talent on display here is profound.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number three</em>: <strong>Crack The Skye by Mastodon</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/mastodon_crack-the-skye_2009.jpg" alt="Crack The Skye by Mastodon" /></p>

<p>A concept album about a paraplegic who gets involved with Russian ghosts told with typical Mastodon intensity, complete with a pretty awesome Rush tribute.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number two</em>: <strong>Beggars by Thrice</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/thrice_beggars_2009.jpg" alt="Beggars by Thrice" /></p>

<p>Probably my favorite band, Thrice turns yet another new page in the book of their ever-changing styles. Beggars is groovy and filled with Dustin Kensrue’s typical lyrical thoughtfulness.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Number one</em>: <strong>Daisy by Brand New</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/brand-new_daisy_2009.jpg" alt="Daisy by Brand New" /></p>

<p>Brand New brings an intensity to a genre that (rightly) gets accused of being stale. Seeing these guys perform songs from both Daisy and Your Favorite Weapon live is an incredible sight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/the-avett-brothers_i-and-love-and-you_2009.png" alt="I And Love And You by The Avett Brothers" /></p>

<p>I first heard <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/">The Avett Brothers</a> on a mix CD that a friend and I were listening to in the car. <em>Talk on Indolence</em> came on, and we both looked at each other in amazement. I begged him to find out from the friend who made the mix who these guys were and if they had any more music.</p>

<p>The Avett Brothers have come a long way since then. They have steadily become better musicians and singers, and they have reached a certain level of mainstream fame (cf. their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3H5BhWQij8">appearance on Letterman</a>.) <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The%2520Avett%2520Brothers/I%2520And%2520Love%2520And%2520You">I And Love And You</a></em> represents both a pinnacle of achievement for the North Carolina trio and an indication that they are not quite finished sharing their music with the world.</p>

<p>One thing that is immediately noticeable is a focus on richer songs filled with more and varied instruments than before. The piano is featured fairly heavily. The production of this album is excellent; each song feels full and finished, which is not something that one usually thought of when listening to previous efforts. One other thing to note is the prominence of drums in most of the songs: this is somewhat unusual for a band that does not have a permanent drummer. The trio take turns drumming when they play live, and it works very well.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Avett+Brothers/_/I+And+Love+And+You">I And Love And You</a></em> is a great opening track, full of dynamic and great piano playing. The track perfectly encompasses the whirlwind rise that the band has experienced over the past year or so. <em>The Perfect Space</em> is another lush piano track, with a great transition to a pop-piano-rock feel in the second half of the song.</p>

<p>A track that showcases the drums that I mentioned above is the aptly-named <em>Kick Drum Heart</em>. Very catchy, very poppy, and very good.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tracks on the album is <em>Slight Figure Of Speech</em>. It evokes the jangley pop of the sixties while still managing to sound fresh. I was lucky enough to hear a live version of this track in Austin last October, and it sounded great.</p>

<p>It’s incredible, but I had never heard of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/dredg">Dredg</a> before this album. I was seriously missing out, but I am so glad that I found this album. Inspired by Salman Rushdie’s <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/oct/16/salmanrushdie">Imagine There Is No Heaven: A Letter To The Six Billionth Citizen</a></em>, the album is an eclectic mix of experimental and art rock. Every song brings something to the table, but the entire album is marked by impeccable production and great musicianship.</p>

<p>A large number of tracks comprise the album; some shorter instrumentals and breaks intersperse longer, more traditional songs. <em>Drunk Slide</em> is the first of these, and even though it’s less than ninety seconds long, it is still a worthy listen. <em>Ireland</em>, the track that immediately follows, is one of the highlights of the album. It’s one of those tracks that makes you want to sing along, even if you don’t know the words. That quickly becomes a theme of the record.</p>

<p>There are so many eclectic styles of music on this record that it’s hard to sum it up. The album is definitely meant to be listened to as a whole, but that doesn’t mean that each song doesn’t stand on its own. Take <em>Mourning This Morning</em>, for instance. The peppy palm-muted guitar that plays throughout the song almost makes you want to dance. The preceding track, <em>I Don’t Know</em> is a poppy little rock groove, and a couple tracks later comes <em>Long Days And Vague Clues</em>, a song that could be straight out of a seventies spy flick.</p>

<p><em>Pariah</em> certainly requires the listener’s attention, but it is well worth every moment.</p>

<p>Dredg dedicated the album to <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Deftones">Deftones</a> bassist Chi Cheng, who was left in a coma after a horrific car accident in November 2008.</p>

<p>No one ever said that <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Converge">Converge</a></em> wasn’t intense, but <em>Axe To Fall</em> hits you right in the face from the very first measure. If opener <em>Dark Horse</em> is a frantic mashing together of everywhere you expected <em>Converge</em> to evolve to, the next track throws all that away. <em>Reap What You Sow</em> still maintains that manic pace, but throws in synths and an absolutely ridiculous guitar solo. Like, straight out of Kirk Hammet’s curly locks guitar solo. If you aren’t out of breath by the time you’ve finished listening to the first two tracks, then you didn’t listen closely enough. I’m not sure that <em>Converge</em> could play this album live from start to finish because I’m not sure any human beings could keep up such a relentless onslaught.</p>

<p>The title track brings back some of that chaotic Converge riffage that we all remember from <em>Jane Doe</em>, but then <em>Effigy</em> shoves even more synthy goodness down your throat.</p>

<p><em>Axe</em> is evidence that Converge is evolving, and their direction could not be more pointed. They have obviously always been talented musicians, but it’s almost like it took this long for the band to realize that they could showcase their diversity and musical maturity with no fear.</p>

<p>The most remarkable parts of this album come at the end. The final two tracks are such a radical departure from the chaos of the rest of the album. <em>Cruel Bloom</em> is almost a sort of weird Tom Waits tribute, if Tom Waits were in to haunting your nightmares. The slow pace is a change, but you can still feel the intensity that the band projects. I’m not sure if that’s because of the residue from the rest of the album, but this song certainly stands on its own.</p>

<p>Closer <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YojThNUSpkw">Wretched World</a></em> is a work of art. I know that a lot of Converge fans won’t want to hear this one at a show, but no one can deny the emotion that this song evokes. A lot of Jacob Bannon’s lyrics come from a heartbroken point of view, but this song manages to wrap some of the saddest lyrics in such beautiful music. I would love to hear more from this side of Converge.</p>

<p>When it’s over, <em>Axe To Fall</em> is Converge’s strongest effort to date. I don’t think they’ll be playing on your local radio station any time soon, but this album is strong enough to please fans of old while perhaps opening some new eyes to this quartet’s music.</p>

<p>I have a bone to pick with <em>Portugal. The Man</em>. The <a href="http://www.vinylcollective.com/2009/08/06/po-portugal-the-man-the-satanic-satanist-lp-german-import/">European LP</a> comes packaged in a beautiful and intricate piece of folded and cut cardboard. The <a href="http://portugaltheman.merchnow.com/products/104165">US version</a> is just a gatefold. I pre-ordered <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Portugal.+The+Man/The+Satanic+Satanist">The Satanic Satanist</a></em> on vinyl in support of the band, and now I wish I had the “cool version.” Fortunately, the packaging of an album has no bearing on the quality of the music inside. (But seriously, I covet that artwork.)</p>

<p><em>Satanist</em> is one of those pop rock albums that goes just far enough into left field to pique your interest with every song but stays mainstream enough to make it a hit at any party you host. I was singing along with this album before I even knew the words. The Beatles influences abound here, but where that might be an insult to some (or even many) bands, Portugal. The Man knows how to use their idols for inspiration and not for source material.</p>

<p><em>Lovers in Love</em> remains my favorite track on <em>Satanist</em> even though there are ten other contenders for the top spot on this eleven track album. Something about John Gourley’s falsetto and the fast-paced wah-guitar and bongos of the chorus just really hits me in the right way. The entire album has this groove to it that mandates that you listen to it as a whole. The cohesion of the songwriting and the musicianship is uncanny. I made mention of the “singability” of this album earlier, but I must repeat it again because it’s so important. You’ll be singing along to <em>Lovers</em>, <em>Everyone is Golden</em>, and <em>The Home</em> before you’ve finished listening to those songs for the first time. I think that’s a sign of a band that really understands the art of songwriting, and these guys certainly aren’t afraid to show off their talent.</p>

<p>It’s been a long time coming, but I think <em>Portugal. The Man</em> is about to become something big. The quintet has already recorded a follow-up to <em>Satanist</em> to be released this coming spring, but this album already goes a long way towards convincing the world that punctuation <em>in medias res</em> is cool again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/images/album/horse-the-band_desperate-living_2009.jpg" alt="Desperate Living by HORSE the Band" /></p>

<p>It might be considered rash to place an album that you have been listening to for less than two weeks in your top ten list of best albums of the year, but I don’t think choosing <em><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/HORSE+the+band/Desperate+Living">Desperate Living</a></em> as my number nine album is a decision I’ll regret. HORSE the Band is certainly not a mainstream band (their chiptune beats and hardcore tendencies mixed with Nathan Winneke’s bizarre lyrics is not a combination that everyone can get into), but this is great music with a huge sense of originality.</p>

<p>The first track I heard from <em>Desperate Living</em> was <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF_v7ek5o-s">Shapeshift</a></em>. What starts out as a moody and ethereal track soon crashes into blast beats and screams, which soon transforms into this sort of alt-rock breakdown, which is then interrupted by what can only be described as the soundtrack to a Game Boy game from 1993. It only gets weirder from here, and this is only one track! <em>Xiu Xiu</em> frontman Jamie Stewart makes an angelic contribution to the song’s outro, which is somewhat unusual for a <em>HORSE</em> track.</p>

<p>The album is filled with pitch-shifted tones that remind you of the warped soundtracks from bad VHS transfers and some of the most intricate guitar and drum work out there. If that’s not a mind-bender, I don’t know what is. Here’s the thing: it all sounds amazing. Every single track keeps you on your toes and gets you to alter all of your expectations. I must have listened to this album more than ten times already, and I hear something new every time.</p>

<p><em>Desperate Living</em> is certainly a step forward for <em>HORSE the Band</em> in terms of sound and songwriting, but there is still that familiar “Nintendo-core” vibe and wacky humor that longtime fans have come to expect. Take the end of of the title track for instance: The words “I’m a plumber, but what I plumb is the fruit of infinity. I’m deeper than infinity, so infinite, I look infinity look like a four” are spoken with no explanation whatsoever. And there’s that bit about dinosaurs in the aforementioned <em>Shapeshift</em>. And the nearly-comical synth breakdowns on <em>The Failure of All Things</em>. And they fact that they named a song after themselves. And the album’s cover artwork.</p>
