  <div class="entry-content"><p>In trying to post about <a href="http://thomas.fiveuptons.com/blog/?p=188">my modified Twitter stats script</a>, I ran into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403">403 Forbidden</a> error every time I tried to publish. I could write and publish test posts with minimal text, but I could not post what I had written about my scripts.</p>

<p>At first I thought it was an outdated version of Wordpress that was responsible for the error. However, upgrading to 2.3 did not fix anything. I simply ignored the error and conceded that I would not be able to post anything for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">Wordpress 2.5</a> was released today, and I decided to try posting once more. I still got the same error. This time, I decided to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=You%20don%27t%20have%20permission%20to%20access%20%2Fblog%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%20on%20this%20server.">Google the issue</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://forums.asmallorange.com/index.php?showtopic=3631&amp;st=0&amp;p=26154&amp;">results</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/135394">are</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/117993?replies=2">not</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/37489">suprising</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Wordpress has some parsing issues when posts contain certain PHP commands. Apparently, modifying the mod_security rules in .htaccess helps to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Adding the following code to the .htaccess file in <code>wp-admin/</code> does the trick.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_security.c&gt;
    SecFilterEngine Off
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.tweetstats.com/">TweetStats</a> webifies a version of these Twitter statistics.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/twitter_stats-300x154.png" alt="Twitter stats, by hour." /></p>

<p>Damon Cortesi wrote a <a href="http://dcortesi.com/2007/12/27/twitter-stats/">pretty nifty script to grab some Twitter statistics</a>. A bunch of people modified his script in order to <a href="http://bradkellett.com/twitter_stats.html">webify it</a>, <a href="http://michael-mccracken.net/wp/2008/01/02/twitter-stats-in-svg-using-gnuplot/">plot the results using gnuplot</a>, and <a href="http://iamthewalr.us/blog/2008/01/02/twitter-stats/">plot the results with the Google Charts API</a>.</p>

<p>This last modification really intrigued me, as I know there are <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/01/chartmaker-tool-for-google-chart-api.html">a few wrappers for the Google Charts API</a> available, including one for Python. I decided to modify <a href="http://iamthewalr.us/blog/2008/01/02/twitter-stats/">Colin Barrett’s Python script</a> that uses the Google Charts API to use the <a href="http://pygooglechart.slowchop.com/">pygooglechart</a> module.</p>

<p>So now instead of:</p>

<pre><code>if f[0] == "\n":
    s = "http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=bvg&amp;chbh;=15&amp;chs;=600x300&amp;chd;=t:%s&amp;chxt;=y,x&amp;
    chxr=0,0,%d&amp;chtt;=%s"
    s = s % ( str(map(lambda x: x*100/max(v), v)).replace(" ", "")[1:-1], max(v), t )
</code></pre>

<p>we have:</p>

<pre><code># If we are at a newline, we have just finished gathering data for a single chart
if fields[0] == "\n":
    # Most of the time we are generating a vertical bar chart
    chart = GroupedVerticalBarChart(600, 300)
    # Set the y-axis range according to the current data
    chart.set_axis_range(Axis.LEFT, 0, max(chartData))
</code></pre>

<p>I also commented my modifications because I’m still on winter break and I felt like it.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/pygooglechart_twitter_stats.zip">download my modified script here</a>. Make sure you have the pygooglechart module and read the included README.txt file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/pandora-jam1.png" alt="PandoraJam" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> is, at first glance, an application that allows a user to listen to her <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> radio stations without using a browser window. Delve a little deeper, however, and one will find a well designed, impeccably implemented, and easy to use application chock full of useful features.</p>

<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>

<p>PandoraJam provides a wrapper to the Pandora.com Flash radio player. The main window displays the Pandora interface, complete with controls and the station picker. Below the radio are a master volume slider, a drop down menu for streaming audio to an Airport Express, a pause button, a skip button, and a record button. Next to the record button is a magnifying glass that locates the currently recording track in Finder, a nice little touch that helps avoid digging through directories to find your audio files. The application exudes Mac-ness, if only because of the juicy play control buttons.</p>

<h2 id="recording--itunes-integration">Recording + iTunes Integration</h2>

<p>PandoraJam really shines when it comes to grabbing Pandora’s stream. Recording can be set to begin on launch of the application, or a user can manually begin recording at any time. After a recording has completed, PandoraJam can automatically add the files to iTunes. PandoraJam creates its own playlist folder group, and adds each song to a separate playlist according to the Pandora station from which the song was recorded. This is a nice touch, especially when one wants to listen to a time-shifted Pandora station on his iPod.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-support">Third-party Support</h2>

<p>It seems as if every audio-related application has <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> support these days, and I love it. Last.fm keeps tracks of your music-listening habits and makes recommendations based upon your most-listened-to artists. Simply enter your Last.fm username and password and start scrobbling!</p>

<p>Growl support for almost every conceivable action (do I need an alert to let me know I just thumbed-up a song?!) can come in useful if PandoraJam is in the background. I personally love Growl’s music video style to let me know the title and artist of a song as it starts playing.</p>

<p>PandoraJam can also update the status of chat clients Adium, iChat, and Skype. This cross-application status update is a neat feature that <a href="http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/moodswing/">all the kids seem to be playing with</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most surprising features of PandoraJam is its ability to transmit audio to an Airport Express. I am not sure why, but there seem to be very few applications that have Airport Express support built in. This is really the feature that sold me on PandoraJam; listening to Pandora radio anywhere in the house is something for which I have longed for quite some time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> is $15 and is available from <a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/">BitCartel</a>. It is a great utility for music listeners and lovers, with that Mac OS X design ethos that we all love and desire in all our apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/212/512702336_20d98702aa_o.png" alt="Google Reader Shared Tags" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/">Google Reader</a>’s tag sharing feature allows people who use Google Reader to satiate their RSS appetite to share certain tags with anyone and everyone else.  I’ve started a system where I use the first name of friends with whom I want to share items.  It saves me from having to ask them to sign up for <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, and all I have to do is send them the link once and request that they bookmark it.</p>

<p>After noting that the URLs for these “nametags” had a similar structure, I decided to replace the name with another tag of mine, the “mac” tag.  I was immediately taken to a page that had all my items that were filed under “mac.”  There’s just one problem.  I have never told Google Reader to make that tag public.</p>

<p>Is this a bug in Google Reader’s implementation, or is in just an artifact that occurs as a result of the social nature of the webapp?  Surely Google should not mislead its users into believing that certain pages are not public when in fact anyone with whom you have shared a tag link can access your other tag pages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.thomasupton.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/snipshot_d4qr5b2m6gw.png" alt="Peel for OS X" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.getpeel.com/">Peel for OS X</a> is a beta music blog client that aggregates mp3 files from user-specified music blogs, and allows you to view the music blog right there in the app.  While it is great software, using it for one day has made me realize that a lot of potentially deal-breaking features are missing from this piece of software.  Thankfully, this is the reason public betas were invented, and, without further ado and in no particular order whatsoever, here is my wish-list for Peel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Better Flagged Songs Management</p>

    <p>I want a central location (separate window, source list, whatever) for all the songs that I have flagged.  Sometimes I don’t have time or I don’t want to download a song, but I’d like to flag it in order to deal with it later.  I need to be able to see all flagged songs, regardless of the music blog from which they originally came.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Downloads Window</p>

    <p>A window would be much easier to manage and visualize than those small progress bars that are currently in place.  Additionally, it would be nice if there was a way to scan the download directory to see if the downloaded songs are still there.  The check mark that appears next to a downloaded song will always remain present, even when the downloaded song has been removed from the hard drive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Search</p>

    <p>Let me search for artists, songs, music blogs (on the web, not search for local files), and, while we’re at it, make adding blogs easier.  Get website titles automatically, and don’t make me enter a title just to add a new music blog.  Handle feed URLs as well as music site URLs, too.  Peel crashed while adding a Wordpress RSS feed to the source list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better iTunes Integration</p>

    <p><em>Please</em> let me add Peel songs to a specific playlist.  I don’t want these singles mucking up my pristine album-only music library.  I spent way too much time tagging my music library to have it littered with improperly tagged music.  If you give me the option to add to a playlist, I can reduce this mess a lot more efficiently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better Playback Controls</p>

    <p>Allow me to shuffle songs, both within individual blogs and globally.  Make the spacebar a play/pause  button, and reflect that in the Controls menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> support would be awesome, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds">Ben Folds</a> played last night in the Burruss Hall auditorium on campus.  I have known about and listened to Ben Folds for quite some time (when he was still with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds+Five">his Five</a>), but I’m not too familiar with a lot of his music right now.</p>

<p>Folds is an extremely talented musician, and that may be an understatement.  His song-writing skills elicit notions that maybe, just maybe, the mass-produced pop music of today’s scene leave a lot to be desired.  His music is upbeat, even poppy, but it’s intelligent, humorous, and witty.</p>

<p>The evening was opened by a musician named <a href="http://www.myspace.com/eefbarzelay">Eef Barzelay</a>, and while he made the crowd laugh with his pointed songs, something about his sound seemed to be off.  Maybe it was his overly harsh acoustic guitar tone, or maybe the loudness of his microphone, but something was definitely unusual about his set.</p>

<p>The Ben Folds show was great, with the obligatory <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Q3C4N6p78io">Bitches Ain’t Shit</a> cover, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSsB74HG7jo">a rendition</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Postal+Service">The Postal Service’s</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Postal+Service/_/Such+Great+Heights">Such Great Heights</a>.  At one point in the show, Folds slowed it down for a few songs.  After making it clear that he wanted to get through the song Gracie with no “hootin’ and hollerin’”, Folds must have started the song over five or six times, but we all eventually got through it.</p>

<p>Folds’ backing band was amazingly talented.  To be able to generate that sort of sound with three musicians and no guitar is incredible.  Folds’ new synth (complete with obligatory <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xym7RlVhzzo">Final Countdown</a> riffage) added a new element to the show.</p>

<p>It was a great show overall, and I left as a bigger fan of Ben Folds than as I entered.</p>

<p>I recently reinstalled OS X, created a Windows partition with Boot Camp, and installed Parallels.  I normally wouldn’t have done that, but there are some Windows-only programs that we need for classes, most notably LogicWorks.  This screen shot should speak for itself.</p>
