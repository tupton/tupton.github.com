  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/21027787/"><img src="http://photos17.flickr.com/21027787_7e6090a61d.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a> - It blocks ads.  Really well.  I use <a href="http://www.pierceive.com/filtersetg/">this site</a> for all my filters.  Instructions are in the directory at the top.  Apparently, there is a new <a href="http://bene.sitesled.com/adblock.htm">Adblock Plus</a> in the works, but as of right now, it is not part of the official builds. The new version allows whitelisting of sites, but can anyone tell me when you <em>want</em> ads to be shown while browsing?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/automarks">Automarks</a> - This nifty extension copies your bookmarks to Autocomplete so that when you start typing in the location bar, your bookmarks show up in the drop down menu. The only gripe I have is that you have to tell it to copy them yourself, meaning that after clearing your History you need to Automark again. Surely it could be made to update your Autocomplete history every few minutes?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://roachfiend.com/archives/2005/02/07/bugmenot/">Bug Me Not</a> - This amazing extension allows you to right click a login form on a registration-required site (such as <a href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a>) and use an anonymous login to bypass said compulsory site registration.  Astounding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.cusser.net/extensions/disabletarget/">Disable Targets For Download</a> - Ever notice that a new window (<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_FAQs_:_About:config_Entries#Browser..2A"> or tab, for trendy about:config geeks</a>) opens when you click a file to download?  This extension stops those new windows, complete with a user-defined list of file extensions to use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.epigoon.com/?page=feedview">Feedview</a> - Why Firefox does not do this by default I do not know, but this extension displays RSS XML files with a pretty stylesheet.  I know that Sage (see below) makes this superfluous, but this makes Firefox handle RSS more like Safari does.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://gorgias.de/mfe/">FLST</a> (scroll down to the bottom) - Focus Last Selected Tab does exactly that.  When you close a tab, Firefox will make active the last tab that had focus, as opposed to making active the next tab in line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> - This extension is probably one of the most flexible and versatile extensions out there.  Greasemonkey allows you to modify sites’ content through javascript.  <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts">This wiki</a> has a lot of useful scripts to get you started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=112">LastTab</a> - Similar to FLST, this extension modifies the behavior of Ctrl-Tab to focus the last selected tab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage</a> - This is my most used extension.  Sage is an RSS aggregator that resides in Firefox’s sidebar.  Click a button to discover feeds on the current site, add, and read.  I use <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">Jon Hicks’</a> <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/sage-on-os-x">Sage modifications for OS X</a>, even on my PC.  For Windows I get rid of the Mac throbber by commenting out the following code from userChrome.css:
<code>#rssStatusImage[loading="true"] {
list-style-image: url("sage/checking.gif") !important;
}</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.pikey.me.uk/mozilla/">Show Failed URL</a> (third from the bottom) - By default, Firefox does not show the URL of a page that failed to load; instead it pops up a rather nasty dialog box.  Before you install this extension, type about:config into the location bar, and then type browser.xul into the filter box.  There should only be one option visible; change it to true.  Now, when a page does not load in Firefox, the URL remains in the location bar and there are no more popup dialogs to click through!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&amp;id=460">Sort Extensions</a> - Pretty self explanatory.  You can see the changes it makes to the extensions window in the image above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/undoclosetab">undoclosetab</a> - This extension keeps a history of up to three closed tabs.  Middle click the tab bar, or right click and choose through the context menu to enable.  Unfortunately, it does not work between browser sessions, so if you close a tab, then close the window, it will not remember your last closed tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/copyimage">Copy Image</a> - It adds Copy Image To Clipboard to the context menu of an image.  Very useful, but why is it not built in to Firefox?  I seem to remember enabling this in about:config, but I could not find it again.  If anyone knows anything, please let me know.<em>Update</em>: After looking at my work PC’s context menu, I can see that this functionality is built in to Firefox 1.0.4.  However, on my Powerbook at home, it was not available.  I recently had to do a clean install of Firefox, which meant reinstalling all of my extensions, so I am positive that Copy Image was not there.  Interesting that the menu item is “Copy Image To Clipboard” in the extension but just “Copy Image” in the Windows build.  I’ll have to check on my Windows laptop at home to see if Copy Image is available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of my extensions come from <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/">The Extension Room</a> and the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/">Mozilla Add-Ons Page</a>. Feel free to browse through those archives and let me know if you find anything interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a little late to the scene with this one, but to be honest, I had no idea what <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> was.  I did not understand the premise of the service, and I did not (at first) see what benefits it offered.</p>

<p>I must have been blind.</p>

<p>del.icio.us is a social bookmarking community.  Buzzwords aside, del.icio.us lets one post bookmarks to a web page that anyone can access.  The site keeps track of <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/e47d06a59309774edab56813438bd3ce">how many people bookmark a certain site</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">how popular sites are</a> based on how many recent bookmarkings particular sites have had.</p>

<p>The feature that really makes investing is del.icio.us worthwhile is tagging.  One may add as many tags to a link as he wants.  For instance, if I bookmarked this site I would tag it with “blog” and perhaps even “apple.”  <a href="http://del.icio.us/third">Since I started using the service</a> last week, I have about one hundred bookmarks and hundreds more tags.</p>

<p>del.icio.us can be used for countless different things, most of which make your life a lot easier.</p>

<p>At work, I’ll see an item I might want to buy while browsing, but I won’t have the time to look into it.  Instead of gmailing myself with a new bookmarks file, I just click a little snippet of javascript in my Bookmarks Bar and the link is ready on my site for when I get home later that evening.</p>

<p>Instead of searching Google for Firefox keyboard shortcuts, I just typed “<a href="http://del.icio.us/tags/firefox+keyboard/">http://del.icio.us/tags/firefox+keyboard/</a>” and found exactly what I was <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard">looking for</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This just keeps getting better!</p>

<p>If you Command-Click (<em>not</em> Ctrl-Click) or click-hold the Auto-Click RSS folders in the Bookmarks Bar, you can see each individual feed that resides in your RSS Bookmarks Bar folder.  In the screenshot below, you can see that I have all my Tech blogs that I read daily listed.  I can just click one of them to see just that feed, or I can click “Open In Tabs” to open each feed in its own tab.  In case I hadn’t checked a feed in a while, the number of unread items would show up in parentheses to the right of the title.</p>

<p>So, in the morning I click the RSS folders to get my morning updates, but throughout the day, I’ll click-hold to read just the updated feeds.  Yet another way that Safari RSS is one of the best ways to read your daily feeds!</p>

<p>Hmm, something else I just noticed is that if you click-hold and choose a feed, it opens in the current tab.  If you Command-Click and choose, the feed opens in a new tab.  I guess that goes along with Command-Clicking any other link or folder of links to open in tabs, except that the same is not true for clicking “View All RSS Articles.” This option saves and then replaces all currently open tabs.  Click the Back button to restore your tab session.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, I’m <a href="http://www.dvorak-keyboard.com/">still using it</a>.</p>

<p>I have fully adjusted to using Dvorak, and I love it.  My typing speed has increased, I don’t look at the keyboard nearly as much, I have much less stress on my wrists and fingers while typing, and I have retained my QWERTY typing speed.</p>

<p>It’s quite funny to see people at work struggle with it when they try to show me something on my own computer.  I have a hot key enabled to switch between Dvorak and QWERTY, so it’s not a hindrance, but it does make me laugh.  On my Mac I have the layout set so that all commands that use the Command key are mapped to their old keys, so Cmd-C copies and Cmd-V pastes.  However, Windows does not have this option (or at least not one that was visible to me.  Anyone have any tips?), so Ctrl-I and Ctrl-. have to be used, respectively.  It’s interesting switching from Windows to OS X and back again, but it keeps me on my toes and I don’t mind too much.</p>

<p>I recommend this layout to everyone and anyone who wants to learn to type quickly, properly, and <em>comfortably</em>.  If you have two weeks to memorize the new layout (yeah, that means students who just got out of school…), you should at least give it a try.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple’s</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X 10.4 Tiger</a> has been out for a week and a half, and I’m sure that everyone has been blogged silly about how great it is.</p>

<p>One decision I had to make when I upgraded was whether or not to use Safari RSS or continue to use the amazing <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>.  I came up with a method of reading Safari’s RSS feeds that was even better than FF’s amazing <a href="http://sage.mozdev.org/">Sage RSS aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>What I did first was re-bookmark all the Sage RSS feeds I had previously in Safari.  Apparently, one can export the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050501091356426">OPML feed from Sage and import this to Safari</a>, but I did it the long way.</p>

<p>Using the very nifty All RSS Feeds folder in the bookmarks sidebar in Safari, I dragged my daily must-read RSS (and Atom) feeds (as in, all the feeds from Sage) into the Bookmarks Toolbar folder.  Once you have all of them in the toolbar folder, you are free to organize them however you want.  I put all my RSS feeds into “Safari RSS” and then organized them into subfolders, such as News and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>OK, wowee, I just moved some bookmarks around so I could reach them with one less click.  Well, here’s the clincher.
I checked the “Auto-click” box next to my feed folder.  Yay!  This now opens all the RSS links contained in the folder in one nicely presented Safari RSS tab.  I then told Safari to Sort By New, Recent Articles by All, and made sure that Source was All.  If I wanted to see just the newest <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> posts, I just click the feed’s name in the Source list.</p>

<p>Another nice benefit of this is that (if you have the “Automatically update articles in: Bookmarks Bar” box checked in Safari’s RSS Preferences) you can also see the number of new RSS articles displayed right on the Bookmarks Toolbar, instead of in a sidebar like Sage.  Which is most important for 12” Powerbook users.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> is a still-in-beta photo sharing portal.  I’m sure that everyone has heard of Webshots before, but Flickr is infinitely better.  A Flash-based interface (sometimes annoying but very well done) is used to display individual images, along with a multitude of options with which you can organize.</p>

<p>The best part of the site, however, is the social tagging features.  You can see everyone’s photos (as long as they are marked as public,) and sort through them with tags.  A lot of tags are worth checking out, such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/memorymap/">memory maps</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/transparentdesktop/">transparent desktops</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you can blog about any picture that you are looking at while logged in.  This picture is of Meghan by a creek on her campus, and this post was made on Flickr’s website.  Give it a try.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/">Donnie Darko</a> is an amazing film.  I didn’t find out about it until December 2004, three years after it orignially hit US theatres, and I am ashamed for it.</p>

<p>On the surface it seems to be a teenage story of a confused kid and his visions.  A second and third viewing reveal this movie to be much more.  Although it comes across as a rather pretentious film, the symbolism and imagery are just too vivid to ignore.  A quick (or involved) visit to the <a href="http://www.donniedarko.com/">web site</a> gives you an inkling of what this film entails.</p>

<p>I’m not going to post a plot summary here; you have to go out and watch this film yourself.  Do yourself a favor and watch the original first, followed by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0006GAOBI/qid=1112589613/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-4190662-4857520?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846">Director’s Cut</a> a day or two later.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“Donnie Darko?  What the hell kind of name is that?  It’s like you’re some sort of superhero or something.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think I’m not?”</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> is a new tool from <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> that does just what you think it’s supposed to do: it gives you maps of pretty much anywhere in America.  The really neat part is that you can drag the map, zoom in and out, and view waypoints on the map without having to reload the map every time you change something.</p>

<p>They have a few examples on the page itself, but you really should try it out.  For example, I searched <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=blacksburg%2C%20va&amp;spn=0.114502%2C0.233818">Blacksburg, Va</a>, for <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=chinese&amp;spn=0.057251%2C0.116909&amp;sll=37.229444%2C-80.414167&amp;sspn=0.114502%2C0.233818">Chinese food</a>, and, lo and behold, we have even more Asian food possibilities than even I knew about here in the old ‘Burg.  A search for <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=free%20wifi&amp;ll=37.289063%2C-80.416550&amp;spn=0.916016%2C1.870546&amp;sll=37.229444%2C-80.414167&amp;sspn=0.114502%2C0.233818">free wifi</a> yields similar results.</p>

<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=ny%2C%20ny%20to%20la%2C%20ca">Driving directions</a> are intense!  Try clicking the number next to each step of the directions.  Amazing!</p>

<p>Google continues to be a paragon of software and business awesomeness.</p>
