<p>This may be old news, but Amazon seems to indicate which albums it sells are copy protected.  I haven’t looked to see if any other albums are flagged like this, but it seems that “Copy Protected CD” is one of the formats that is listed on
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature-pop-up/-/570000/ref=cd_format_pop/002-6181845-7529664">Amazon’s Buying Guide</a>.  When was this implemented, and do they catch all copy protected media?  Has anyone bought an seemingly normal album from Amazon only to find that it was copy protected?</p>

<p>Even though this indication is nice, a copy protected work is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc#Copy_protection">technically a CD</a>, but I think Amazon labeled it as such to reduce confusion.</p>

<p>This past Monday, Yahoo announced the purchase of desktop widget application <a href="http://konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a>.  With the purchase came the announcement that Konfabulator would be free, and anyone who bought version 2.0 or later would be eligible for a refund of the application’s former $20 charge.</p>

<p>I like Konfabulator <em>almost</em> better than Dashboard.  Dashboard seems to have <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/status/sysstat.html">more</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/transportation/googlemapswidget.html">useful</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/music/symphonic.html">widgets</a>, while Konfabulator seems to have more <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=36689">“just for fun”</a> widgets.</p>

<p>However, Konfabulator offers cross-platform ubiquity and, with the involvment of Yahoo, an open API for developers to make the most of this potential content delivery system.</p>

<p>My solution?  Use both!  With <a href="http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/06/more-ram.html">1.25 GB of RAM</a>, I have the specs to handle it, and the 20” Cinema Display definitely offers the screen real estate.  I only run a few widgets in each application, and it’s not too taxing on my system.</p>

<p>The picture frame widget now integrates <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> photos, and the weather widget provides a link to Yahoo weather and gets its weather information from the <a href="http://www.weather.com/index.html">Weather Channel</a>, which is marginally better than <a href="http://home.accuweather.com/index.asp?partner=accuweather">AccuWeather</a> (I prefer <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">Weather Underground</a> for accuracy.)</p>

<p>With the availability of the same widgets on both Windows and OS X and the involvement of a new Yahoo dev community, Konfabulator could be well on its way to becoming a new means of grabbing the information that you want, whether it’s from your system or from a feed of your favorite site.</p>

<p>This all leads me to wonder:  What will Google’s answer be?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the first things I do when sitting down at a Windows machine is to switch the appearance to Windows Classic.  The default theme is too unimaginative, and looks like a candy shop.  I do use Windows, especially at school where they use Visual Studio to code.  I like Windows and I know my way around it quite well, but it’s no OS X and I use it as little as possible.  Therefore, the look and feel is quite important to me, even if I’m only using it for a small percentage of the time.</p>

<p>On more than <a href="http://www.auroravisions.com/opendir/blogstuff/ie7googletoolbar.jpg">one</a> <a href="http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/options/prefwindowv/options.png">occasion</a>, I had seen a theme that was strikingly similar to the default Luna theme, but much more professional looking.  It was glassy; more Aquified if you will.  There was only one problem.  I had no idea what the theme was called, and no way to start looking for it.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a>.  Metafilter is a sort of community blog.  Members are allowed to post once a week, and are expected to post to some of the most interesting sites on the web.  The idea is that the community will filter the web so that only the great and interesting things are posted.  AskMeFi is a subset of this community; members can ask any question they like and normally have an answer within a few hours.</p>

<p>I asked the question <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/21875">What theme is this?</a> and had my answer in less than three minutes.  Absolutely amazing.  I even had someone come and comment on <a href="http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/07/googles-improved-home-page.html">my last post</a> to tell me the answer to my question.  Thanks, guys!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/29943412/"><img src="http://photos22.flickr.com/29943412_89204036d4.jpg" alt="Windows Royale Theme" /></a></p>

<p>It turns out that the theme is called Royale, and it was available through the Windows Media Center edition.  Fortunately, a site had <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml">hosted a ported-to-XP version of the theme</a>.  Later it was found that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=15373C73-D5F6-4AF0-B583-D633CB021612&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft had officially packaged and released the theme</a>, but in order to download the theme, one must go through <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/28/microsoft_genuine_ad.html">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> verification.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/29943411/"><img src="http://photos23.flickr.com/29943411_50199b4fe0.jpg" alt="Windows Royale Theme" /></a></p>

<p>The theme is no Aqua, but it’s much better than the Windows Luna default.  It’s glossy and the colors are not quite as loud; in turn, that makes it less obtrusive and easier to use.  This should be the Windows default theme without a doubt.</p>

<p>Thanks again, AskMeFi, for making the view out of the Window just a little bit brighter!</p>

<p>I <a href="http://uptonianthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/05/googles-web-portal.html">posted earlier</a> about <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google’s customizable home page</a>, and how Slashdot aggregation went awry.  That was fixed shortly after I posted, and I have been using the Google page as my home page ever since.  Last night, Google made some improvements to their page in the form of some nifty Javascript resizing and a new side bar from which to add new content to your personalized page.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/28734146/"><img src="http://photos21.flickr.com/28734146_07ccccb0a7_o.png" alt="Google's Web Portal" /></a></p>

<p>However, I had some issues before I could make the portal work properly.  I use the <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> Firefox extension, and one of the scripts I had enabled Google Suggest functionality on all Google pages.  It never worked on Google’s personalized web page, so I had forgotten that it was installed.  This user script was preventing Google’s own Javascript on the personalized page from working properly, forcing me to use Internet Explorer to personalize my home page.  I won’t link to the script because it is broken, but it is available on the <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts">Greasemonkey Script Repository</a>.</p>

<p>I had a rant already written out about how Google of all companies should realize the importance of cross-platform compatibilty and conforming to standards.  Of course, Google did take care of this, and it does in fact work in Firefox.  Fortunately for me, I cannot post from work, so I avoided being slightly embarrassed (yeah, right, as if anyone is even reading this blog.)</p>

<p>Having said that, <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=157038&amp;cid=13164678">a lot of people</a> seemed to have trouble with it on Slashdot, so either that script was quite prolific or any user script that affects the <a href="http://google.com/ig">http://google.com/ig</a> URL was interfering with the intended functionality.</p>

<p>After the initial speedbumps, I found that these new additions to Google’s homepage were excellent.  I have Google News, a stock ticker, Slashdot, Lifehacker, and Boing Boing feeds, weather, and a Gmail preview all on my homepage.  All of this is customizable with regards to size and location.</p>

<p>Another added bonus is the Bookmarks section.  I use and love
<a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but sometimes it can be a little wonky with the proxy servers at work.  If I find a neat site at work or anywhere that del.icio.us is inaccessible, then I can easily and immediately add it to Google and later post to del.icio.us.  I realize the same is available with My Yahoo!, but I haven’t really warmed to the idea of “My Web” yet.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what Google rolls out next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox web browser</a> had a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/roadmap.html">version realignment</a> today, ultimately resulting in the release of Firefox 1.5 in August / September, with work on FF2.0 and FF3.0 after that.  There will be no Firefox 1.1 release.</p>

<p>With all this versioning adjustment, I got to thinking about the things I wish that I could see from Firefox.  Here’s a quick little list of features I’d like to see from everyone’s favorite red panda.  Some of these features might be a little skewed towards the Mac version, but you can’t hold that against me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bookmark Management</strong>
I love Safari’s bookmark management, and I like <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>’s even better.  It can’t be that hard to integrate into Firefox.  The sidebar is clunky for bookmarks, and you can’t really edit the bookmarks comfortably from there.  Showing keywords as a column in the bookmarks manager instead of in the properties would be nice, as would making all bookmark properites available when bookmarking a new site.  Just the title and location doesn’t cut it, not when quick searches make browsing so much easier.  FTP synchronization of bookmarks would be nice, but any way of backing up and making bookmarks available over the internet (email?) would do just fine.  I also think that quicksearch keywords that are entered in the location bar with no search parameters should go to the page that the search is located on, or even the top level of that particular site.
Whatever methods are used to improve the Bookmark Management UI should also be used for the Extension Management UI.  I hate the current implementation, and it needs to change.  Little windows that pop up just don’t cut it anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Speed</strong>
Especially on OS X, Firefox can be a little sluggish.  Some of those issues have been fixed with the Deer Park releases, which will eventually become Firefox 1.5, but if Camino and Safari (most of the time) can be blazing fast, it shouldn’t take much code rewriting to achieve that on OS X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Native Widgets</strong>
Windows doesn’t have too much of an issue here, but I am pretty sure that the Linux version could use a makeover, and I know for certain that the OS X version needs the GUI equivalent of plastic surgery.  One of the biggest reasons besides speed that Mac users don’t use Firefox is its appearance.  A Mac-ified Firefox has been promised for several months now; can we please see the results of any of the work that has been done with regards to this issue?  <a href="http://kmgerich.com/">Kevin Gerich</a> had some awesome <a href="http://kmgerich.com/archive/000084.html">Mac-ish widgets</a>, but they seem to be broken in FF1.0.5/1.0.6 and he hasn’t updated that blog since January.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inline Spell Checking</strong>
With the proliferation of blogs and news feeds comes an avalanche of feedback comments.  Most of these comments are quick little blurbs that don’t warrant the use of a text editor.  OS X has a system wide spell checker, and I’m sure that something could be worked out for the Windows version.  I know about <a href="http://spellbound.sourceforge.net/">Spellbound</a>, but I want it <em>inline</em>.  That would be awesome.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Having said all that, Firefox in its current form is amazing.  I use Firefox, Safari, and Camino on my Mac, but Firefox is my main browser.  After a short stint of using Safari after Tiger came out, I went back to Firefox for <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a>, <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a>, cross-platform zen and overall awesomeness.  I know that some of these are on the roadmap, and some are bugs  that will eventually get fixed, so I can rest assured that Firefox development is coming along very strong.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am nitpicky, anal, tidy, obsessive, and compulsive about my songs and their ID3 tags.  I have over 7000 songs in my iTunes library; navigating an iPod without the correct tags would be nearly impossible.</p>

<p>On a relatively unrelated note, I’ve been using <a href="http://backpackit.com/">Backpack</a> for a while now, just to keep track of miscellaneous little things about which I need to be reminded.</p>

<p>Often when listening to my iPod at work, I note that some of my tracks are not tagged how I prefer them to be (every word capitalized, correct genre, numbered according to total tracks) and make a mental note about changing them in iTunes when I get home.  Ha!  Mental notes really work, don’t they?  I’m either too busy or, more likely, I just forget.</p>

<p>So today I thought that if I had some kind of todo app that I could use to remind myself, my tracks would get tagged in a more timely manner!  Lo and behold, Backpack fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>I came up with a format for corrections (mostly capitalization errors) and started posting any errors to my iTunes Corrections Backpack page.  Check it out:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/27624675/"><img src="http://photos21.flickr.com/27624675_38fde4708f_o.png" alt="Backpack iTunes Corrections Queue" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the format is</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[artist] – [album</td>
      <td>– trackname] // [what needs correcting</td>
      <td>, correction]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The result is that I know which tracks to correct, and they conform to my own liking.  I like and use <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> for large-scale mass tagging, but sometimes the tags are not totally correct.  This method lets me do it on my own time and in my own manner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/firefox/quick-delicious-search-with-firefox-113221.php">Lifehacker post</a> yesterday about someone who uses the Firefox location bar to search their del.icio.us bookmarks and tags.  Two days before that, there was a <a href="http://www.theappleblog.com/2005/07/18/495/">post on The Apple Blog</a> that briefly mentioned QS and del.icio.us.  This has prompted me to demontstrate how I use del.icio.us and QS together.</p>

<p>First, the del.icio.us plugin needs to be installed.  In B40 and above (the Tiger versions of QS), plugins are available for download in the preferences.  Change the drop down at the top left of the Plugins pane to “Available” in order to see the plugins that you can install.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/third/27587109/"><img src="http://photos21.flickr.com/27587109_c01552fd0a_o.png" alt="QS - Plugin Preferences" /></a></p>

<p>After installing the plugin, go to the Catalog pane.  del.icio.us bookmarks now show up in the Custom part of the Catalog.  Click the “i” button to slide a drawer out in order to enter your del.icio.us information.  Ta-da!  Bookmarks now show up in your Catalog!  Check the box to include tags; this is intrinsic to how I use this part of QS.</p>

<p>Now, invoke QS and start typing the name of a del.icio.us tag.  I typed “int” and found the “interesting” tag.</p>

<p>Then, I <em>pressed the right arrow</em> and watched in amazement as all my del.icio.us bookmarks that are tagged with “interesting” appeared in the QS menu.  Awesome!</p>

<p>You can also search for bookmarks by title as well.  The really neat thing about this method is, if you have the corresponding plugins installed, bookmarks from Firefox, Safari, Camino, and del.icio.us are all available in one place, and they open with your default browser!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes 4.9 was released</a> this morning.  Something rather interesting that I noticed, however, was the <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa">lack of the 30 GB iPod</a> in the online store.  The 30 GB iPod Photo is still advertised on the <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">main iTunes page</a>, meaning that this happened only very recently. Could this mean that new iPods are set to come out today?!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  I guess not.  The 20 GB iPod now has a color screen, and there are only two full size iPods available.  Cool, but where are the 20, 40, and 80 GB iPods?</p>
