<div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve used Google Reader for a long time, but I’ve never been completely satisfied with using it to
read and keep up with RSS feeds. Apps like <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> on the iPad provide a better
reading experience for traditionally “newsy” outlets – I enjoy flipping through the feeds from <em>The
New Yorker</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em> – but following feeds where every item is of
personal interest to me doesn’t make much sense in that context, and it’s iOS-only. I had used
<a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a> a few times in the past, but I never stuck with it for some reason. It’s
a great app, but I would constantly get distracted by that big red badge with a huge number of
unread items in it.</p>

<p>I realized that my problem wasn’t really the apps I was using. What really made reading my feeds
imperfect – or even tedious – was the number of feeds I had and <em>how</em> I was reading them. I decided
to revisit NetNewsWire and check out an app on iOS that I had heard great things about.</p>

<h2 id="prune">Prune</h2>

<p>The first key to revamping my news reading was pruning my subscriptions. I had way too many
high-traffic feeds, and I wasn’t even reading 1% of some of them. I would go through all my feeds
and folders and mark everything as read every few days<sup id="fnref:too-long"><a href="#fn:too-long" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> just to keep up and feel like I
wasn’t overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I got rid of feeds from sites like <a href="http://www.lamebook.com/">Lamebook</a>, which is hilarious, but I don’t need to
read every single item, and <a href="http://www.absolutepunk.net/">Absolute Punk</a>, which is a great source for music news, but I only
want to read a very small portion of those stories. I get my fix from these sites by visiting them
every few days, not by trying to forge through a murky river of hundreds of RSS items that I don’t
want to read.</p>

<p>I now have 26 feeds in 8 categories<sup id="fnref:cross-link"><a href="#fn:cross-link" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, down from twice that before pruning. This is
manageable. 50+ high-traffic feeds are not. I can read the items from these feeds quickly, and I
can finally read “all items” without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<h2 id="netnewswire-revisited-again">NetNewsWire, revisited (again)</h2>

<p>I mentioned that I had used NetNewsWire before, but it never stuck. A couple of weeks ago, I saw
<a href="http://collindonnell.com/2012/06/29/my-netnewswire-window/">this NetNewsWire setup</a> and knew I had to try it. <code>⌘-⇧-R</code> and <code>⌘-/</code> are now my favorite
keyboard shortcuts. Refresh, and then scroll through my unread river of items. I sort
chronologically so I read posts “in order,” but I don’t think it actually matters much at all.
Since I have a low number of feeds, it usually only takes a few minutes to travel through these
unread items. Any links to things I want to check out in more depth later get a quick <code>^-P</code> to send
to Instapaper.</p>

<h2 id="reeder-on-mobile">Reeder on mobile</h2>

<p>I was recently on vacation without my MacBook, but I had my iPad and still wanted to keep up with my
news and feeds. There are plenty of other times that I’m without my computer but have a chance to
catch up on my reading. I figured (or hoped, really) that I could make the experience of reading
news on my iPhone and iPad just as great as it is with NetNewsWire at my desk.</p>

<p>I had heard great things about <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on iOS, but I was skeptical that it could work for
me. It turns out I can get nearly the same river of news setup as NetNewsWire in Reeder. Unread
items can be sorted in chronological order, and moving to the next item is just a matter of swiping
up.</p>

<p>The end result is that I have a streamlined way to catch up on news that’s important to me as
quickly as possible, no matter where I am. I spend less time fiddling with news items I don’t really
care about, less time out of my day being distracted by the latest hot article<sup id="fnref:distract"><a href="#fn:distract" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and more
time doing what I want and need to do.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:too-long">
      <p>I did this ritual for far too long before I realized it needed to end. Old habits die hard. <a href="#fnref:too-long" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:cross-link">
      <p>I’ve noticed that a lot of sites and blogs I read will “cross-post” each other’s items. This sounds like it might be annoying to have to read about the same things in multiple places, but usually one of two things happens: either the cross-posting contains a bit of insightful back-and-forth on a topic, or multiple people link to a great article elsewhere that I know I need to check out. I get to follow great discussions and the cream of the hot topic crop rises to the top of my news readers. Win-win for me. <a href="#fnref:cross-link" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:distract">
      <p>If only I could figure out how to stop checking <a href="http://stellar.io/">Stellar</a> so much.<a href="#fnref:distract" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
