  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently thought it might be a good idea to start using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to run builds of my personal repositories on a regular basis. A lot of my repositories are pet projects, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t depend on them on a daily basis.</p>

<p>That couldn’t be more true of <a href="https://github.com/tupton/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/tupton/dotfiles/blob/a5597784778bca973188300b8fff40f9688b2cf5/zsh/zshrc"><code>zshrc</code></a> and my <a href="https://github.com/tupton/dotfiles/blob/a5597784778bca973188300b8fff40f9688b2cf5/vim/vimrc"><code>vimrc</code></a> get exercised tens if not hundreds of times per day. Sometimes I’ll make a change to test out something new, verify that it doesn’t blow up, commit it, and move on. That’s probably not the best way to do things, but I figure that I’ll never start using the new hotness if I don’t jump in and start using it right away. Usually this works out well and I’ve simply added a new tool to my repertoire, but it can potentially break my environment in subtle ways. Continuous integration can help with that: if I commit a breaking change, I can get an email when the “build” breaks. I’ll immediately know which commit broke something without having to resort to <code>git blame</code> or something similar.</p>

<p>Travis CI offers a fantastic free service, but I haven’t really had a chance to use it yet<sup id="fnref:travis-vs-jenkins"><a href="#fn:travis-vs-jenkins" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I figured that setting up CI for my small dotfiles repository would be a great way to learn a tool that many open source projects use today.</p>

<p>There was one huge hurdle: I use <code>zsh</code>, and most of my dotfile setup scripts are written in <code>zsh</code>, but the <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/">Travis environment</a> only comes with the <code>bash</code> shell installed<sup id="fnref:default-shell"><a href="#fn:default-shell" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen/blob/7860ce7aecdbed8fd8ff75472ac59c52c2ac9a7e/.travis.yml#L32">existing open</a> <a href="https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-bd/blob/e56411daa979996297295515422b618e7419f8fb/.travis.yml#L5">source projects</a> use Travis with <code>zsh</code>, but they all use the legacy environment that still allows <code>sudo</code>, not the <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrating-from-legacy/">newer container-based environment</a>. The <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/apt/">apt addon</a> can help install packages in containers, but the latest version of <code>zsh</code> on Ubuntu 12.04 is 4.3.17. <code>zsh</code> 5 is a requirement for most modern usages, so that’s a non-starter. I thought that someone would have come across this already and solved it, and maybe they have, but I couldn’t easily find a solution.</p>

<p>We need to build and install <code>zsh</code>, and we need to do it without <code>sudo</code>. <code>build-essential</code> is already available on the Travis CI virtual machines, and we could use the aforementioned apt addon if it wasn’t.</p>

<p>After much <a href="https://travis-ci.org/tupton/dotfiles/builds">trial and error</a>, I finally got a Travis config that makes sure a recent version of <code>zsh</code> is set up before running the build. I chose to do this in the <code>before_install</code> step because that <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#The-Build-Lifecycle">seems to be where additional dependencies should be installed</a>, but I suppose it could be done anywhere in the build lifecycle before <code>script</code> runs the actual tests.</p>

<p>The full Travis config follows, but the <code>before_install</code> step is what really matters:</p>

<p>First, we make a temporary directory to install <code>zsh</code> to. Remember, no <code>sudo</code> means no access to <code>/usr/bin/local</code>, so we need to choose a safe location to install.</p>

<p>Next, we download the latest version of <code>zsh</code>. If you want to use a different mirror or download an archive with a different compression, you just need to change this line to handle that and the rest should work. If you change the version, make sure to update the following line that changes directories to the archive you just decompressed.</p>

<p>Then we build <code>zsh</code>: configure with the prefix set to the directory we created earlier, then <code>make</code> it and <code>make install</code> it to the prefixed directory.</p>

<p>Finally, we <code>cd</code> back to the directory we were in – these build lifecycle steps are run in series so we need to hop back to the directory we were in before building <code>zsh</code> – and, more importantly, we add the temporary directory to the beginning of our path so that <code>zsh</code> can be found.</p>

<p>These <code>before_install</code> steps could probably be extracted into a script, but I wanted to go with the simplest Travis config with the least overhead to get up and running with <code>zsh</code>. Now, when the test script runs, <code>zsh</code> is available and we can check our scripts for errors!</p>

<p>I look forward to exploring more of what is possible with Travis. On my horizon: using <a href="https://github.com/Kuniwak/vint"><code>vint</code></a> to lint my vimrc and writing tests for the majority of my private repositories that don’t currently have any verification.</p>

      <p>We use Jenkins at work, which is a blessing and a curse. Mostly the latter, but the sheer number of plugins available coupled with the fact that I work with some awesome people who know Jenkins better than I ever will makes it ok. <a href="#fnref:travis-vs-jenkins" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:default-shell">
      <p>Really, it comes with whatever shell is default for the operating system that Jenkins VMs use. Since <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#Virtualization-environments">they run Ubuntu 12.04</a>, that means that <code>bash</code> is available but <code>zsh</code> is not. It seems like Travis didn’t set out to explicitly support shell-based projects, but because their machines are (mostly) Linux, that comes for “free” if you know how to configure things. <a href="#fnref:default-shell" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>For <a href="http://blog.thomasupton.com/2012/02/configuration/">a while now</a>, I’ve been using <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> to manage my <code>vim</code> plugins as bundles. I thought I was making things easier for myself by <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/">using <code>git</code> submodules to help organize those plugins</a>, but submodules aren’t the best method for deploying a <code>vim</code> environment in multiple places.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, other, smarter people did this same thing and decided to fix it. This <a href="http://jameslaicreative.com/moving-up-upgrading-from-pathogen-to-vundle/">blog post by James Lai</a> details moving from almost the exact same system as mine to <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a>, a newer and very <code>vim</code>-centric way of managing plugins. You list your plugins in your <code>vimrc</code>, you update them with <code>vim</code> (even though they are managed with <code>git</code>), and your <code>vim</code> environment is consistent everywhere.</p>

<p>I just migrated from Pathogen to Vundle, and I want to document the process.</p>

<p>First things first: clone Vundle into your <code>bundle/</code> directory.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">❯ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git bundle/Vundle.vim
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim#quick-start">Vundle quick start guide</a> does a great job of getting you started, so if you’re just looking to use Vundle without any prior bundle management, I would start there. If you were managing your <code>vim</code> plugins with Pathogen and <code>git</code> submodules, the switch to Vundle is straightforward but requires a few more steps.</p>

<p>At the top of <a href="https://github.com/tupton/vim-support/blob/master/vimrc">my <code>vimrc</code></a> I added a new Vundle-specific section and added the code from the quick start guide.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="vim"><span class="line"><span class="c">&quot; Of course</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="k">call</span> vundle#rc<span class="p">()</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">Bundle <span class="s1">&#39;gmarik/vundle&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Next, I wanted to add all the bundles I already use. <code>git submodule foreach</code> can actually help here.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
<span class="line-number">9</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">❯ git submodule foreach git remote -v
</span><span class="line">Entering <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/airline&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">origin  https://github.com/bling/vim-airline.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class="line">origin  https://github.com/bling/vim-airline.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>

</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>I then just copied the GitHub user and repository name (the path portion of the remote URL minus “.git”) and passed that to Vundle’s <code>Bundle</code> command.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="vim"><span class="line"><span class="c">&quot; Better status line</span>
</span><span class="line">Bundle <span class="s1">&#39;bling/vim-airline&#39;</span>

</span><span class="line"><span class="c">&quot; ga for character descriptions</span>
</span><span class="line">Bundle <span class="s1">&#39;tpope/vim-characterize&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line">[...]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Now we need to remove the existing submodules. One of the big pains of using <code>git</code> submodules is removing them when you no longer need them. This made trying out plugins harder than it needed to be, and it makes the transition to Vundle a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>I reference <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1260748/how-do-i-remove-a-git-submodule">this Stack Overflow post about removing <code>git</code> submodules</a> every time I need to remove a plugin I was just trying out without fail. The command to remember is <code>git submodule deinit</code>. You can <code>deinit</code> all submodules in a given directory all at once.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">❯ git submodule deinit bundle/
</span><span class="line">Cleared directory <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/airline&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">Submodule <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/airline&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span>https://github.com/bling/vim-airline.git<span class="o">)</span> unregistered <span class="k">for </span>path <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/airline&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">Cleared directory <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/characterize&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">Submodule <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/characterize&#39;</span> <span class="o">(</span>https://github.com/tpope/vim-characterize.git<span class="o">)</span> unregistered <span class="k">for </span>path <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/characterize&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Then you need to explicitly remove all the bundles. Since Vundle is already in <code>bundle/vundle</code>, we need to remove each separate plugin bundle directory instead of blowing away the entire <code>bundle/</code> directory.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">❯ git rm bundle/airline bundle/characterize <span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class="line">rm <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/airline&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">rm <span class="s1">&#39;bundle/characterize&#39;</span>
</span><span class="line">
</span><span class="line"><span class="o">[</span>...<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It woud be a good idea to commit your staged changes here, which at this point should just be submodule removal.</p>

<p>If you were using Pathogen, don’t forget to remove any setup from your <code>vimrc</code>.</p>

<p>It also helps to add <code>bundle/</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code>. Vundle now puts all plugins there, but you don’t have to manually manage them any more.. Just add <code>bundle/**</code> to your <code>vim</code> environment’s <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

<p>Now, open up <code>vim</code> and run <code>:BundleInstall</code>. All your <code>vim</code> bundles will be cloned and managed by Vundle, and you don’t have to worry about updating submodules and running <code>git submodule foreach</code> everywhere you have a <code>vim</code> environment.</p>

<p>To update and migrate any existing <code>vim</code> environments on other machines, <code>git pull</code> in the migration changes, which shouldn’t conflict as long as you were up to date to the commit before the migration. Then clone Vundle with <code>git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git bundle/vundle</code> and install your plugins with <code>vim +BundleInstall +qall</code>.</p>

<p>If you <em>were not</em> up to date to right before your migration changes, you’ll probably have to manually remove all submodules by following the instructions above and resolve some conflicts when pulling changes in. Since you’re trying to delete all of <code>bundle/</code>, this should be relatively painless: just delete <code>bundle/</code> and <code>git rebase --skip</code> any submodule update commits.</p>

<p>And now you’re using Vundle! Add some new bundles into your <code>vimrc</code>, run <code>:BundleInstall</code>, and you’re up and running. I found some that I’m going to try out in <a href="https://gist.github.com/joegoggins/8482408">joegoggins’s vimrc</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim#quick-start">the Vundle setup documentation</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inevitably, when dealing with time-related data, one will come across Unix timestamps. They’re
great; there’s no guessing the timezone or trying to parse difficult formats and they’re generally
extremely useful.</p>

<p>Except they’re not very readable to humans. I use <a href="http://www.epochconverter.com/">Epoch Converter</a> <em>a lot</em> when I’m dealing
with time-series data, which seems to be fairly often recently. Anything involving a calendar or
picking a time range also usually involves timestamps. I thought there must be an easier way to
convert these into something that I can read without going to an external site and that doesn’t
break down when I’m trying to do work with finnicky or non-existant network connection.</p>

<p>There is:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line">date -j -f <span class="s2">&quot;%s&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1381528800&quot;</span> +<span class="s2">&quot;%a %b %d %T %Z %Y&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>An explanation: <code>-j</code> tells <code>date</code> not to try to set the system date. <code>-f</code> describes the format of
the input - a timestamp, of course - and the input itself follows. The string after <code>+</code> is the
output format. The output of the above is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>Fri Oct 11 17:00:00 CDT 2013
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <code>xargs</code> to pipe input in. Note that the <code>-J</code> option might be different on systems that
are not OS X.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="line"><span class="nb">echo</span> -n <span class="s2">&quot;1381528800&quot;</span> | xargs -J <span class="o">{}</span> date -j -f <span class="s2">&quot;%s&quot;</span> <span class="o">{}</span> +<span class="s2">&quot;%a %b %d %T %Z %Y&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Like I seem to do with a lot of my utility scripts, I added a workflow to Alfred. You can <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5753691/Convert%20timestamp%20to%20date.alfredworkflow">get it
here</a>. Simply invoke Alfred, type “ts” followed by a space and the timestamp you want to
convert. The readable date will be posted as a notification (Growl or Notification Center,
configurable in the Advanced section of the Alfred settings) and copied to the clipboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes it’s useful to copy some code from a file and paste it somewhere else as an example. For
instance, I like to write code in a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a> and then paste a relevant subset of that
code to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> answer. I have also copied code from a project file to paste into
HipChat to quickly explain something to a coworker, or to paste into a JIRA ticket as a comment.</p>

<p>If you copy code from the middle of a file, there’s usually some leading whitespace on all lines
that you do not want to preserve in the context into which you are pasting the code. The problem is
that you don’t want to get rid of <em>all</em> leading whitespace on <em>all</em> lines; you want to keep the
indentation intact. I usually get rid of the unwanted whitespace by manually deleting it
if it’s only one or two lines or by pasting into a new <code>vim</code> buffer and using <code>&lt;&lt;</code> to shift the text
over as much as desired.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I have this text:</p>

<h2 id="remove-leading-whitespace">Remove leading whitespace</h2>

<p>I knew there must be a way to remove the shortest leading whitespace from all lines
programmatically, but I’m not familiar enough with <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, or shell scripting in general to
tackle the problem. I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19328975/remove-shortest-leading-whitespace-from-all-lines/19332908">asked the question on Stack Overflow</a> and got a few great answers. I
ended up accepting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19328975/remove-shortest-leading-whitespace-from-all-lines/19332908#19332908">the single process <code>awk</code> version</a>.</p>

<p>If you use OS X, the built-in <code>awk</code> will not work with the given solution. If you use
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Hombrew</a>, fixing that is just a simple matter of <code>brew install gawk</code> and using <code>gawk</code> instead
of <code>awk</code>.</p>

<p>The given solution has a great explanation and works fine, but I made one addition. If the input is
a single line with <em>no</em> leading whitespace, the script fails. I fixed this with <code>if (!s) s=0;</code> at
the beginning of the <code>END</code> block.</p>

<p>The final version of my command looks like this. I’ve added some comments to explain what’s going
on.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this probably only works on text with spaces for whitespace, not
tabs or mixed whitespace.</p>

<h2 id="integrate-with-an-alfred-workflow">Integrate with an Alfred workflow</h2>

<p>The ability to remove the shortest leading whitespace with a shell command is great, but I really
wanted a way to do this quickly with text on the clipboard. <a href="http://support.alfredapp.com/workflows">Alfred workflows</a> make that
possible.</p>

<p>I created a simple three step workflow with a hotkey trigger, a script action, and a clipboard
output. You can <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5753691/Paste-shifted-text.alfredworkflow">download it here</a> and use it with Alfred 2.</p>

<p>And now you can copy code in context and paste it with no leading whitespace wherever you want!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently came home from a trip and synced my iPhone in iTunes in an attempt to scrobble the music
that I listened to on that trip. I use <a href="http://meloapp.com/faq/">Melo</a> to scrobble tracks played in iTunes, and it usually
works quite well because I never know it’s there.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure if Melo, iTunes, or <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> is to blame, but I ended up with a large amount of
scrobbles from a repeated handful of songs. I have over 75,000 tracks scrobbled in Last.fm, but I
use their recommendations and like to look at my stats, so artificially inflating my scrobble
count with three artists was extremely undesirable.</p>

<p>I had 59 pages of unwanted scrobbles; I needed to quickly delete nearly 3000 scrobbles. Last.fm
doesn’t have a way to batch delete (or otherwise manage) your scrobble tracks, so I manually clicked
all the delete links on the first page.</p>

<p>That got old before I had even deleted ten scrobbles. I figured out a way to programmatically and
quickly delete a page of scrobbles. I still have to manually get to each page, but this makes it
much easier.</p>

<p>I just open up the console with <code>⌘-⌥-I</code>, paste in that snippet of code, and hit enter. Here is what
it looks like in action.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8282/7770297078_73fafc7541_o_d.png" alt="Batch deleting Last.fm scrobbles." title="Last.fm Batch Delete" /></p>

<p>Since <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is already embedded in Last.fm’s pages, I just select all the delete links and
emit a click on each one. The entire page is deleted in a few seconds. When it’s done, I can click
the link to the previous page and repeat.</p>

<p>I don’t expect this will be very useful to anyone but myself for the next ten minutes, but it could
come in handy in case you’ve been listening to too much Carly Rae Jepsen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve used Google Reader for a long time, but I’ve never been completely satisfied with using it to
read and keep up with RSS feeds. Apps like <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> on the iPad provide a better
reading experience for traditionally “newsy” outlets – I enjoy flipping through the feeds from <em>The
New Yorker</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em> – but following feeds where every item is of
personal interest to me doesn’t make much sense in that context, and it’s iOS-only. I had used
<a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a> a few times in the past, but I never stuck with it for some reason. It’s
a great app, but I would constantly get distracted by that big red badge with a huge number of
unread items in it.</p>

<p>I realized that my problem wasn’t really the apps I was using. What really made reading my feeds
imperfect – or even tedious – was the number of feeds I had and <em>how</em> I was reading them. I decided
to revisit NetNewsWire and check out an app on iOS that I had heard great things about.</p>

<h2 id="prune">Prune</h2>

<p>The first key to revamping my news reading was pruning my subscriptions. I had way too many
high-traffic feeds, and I wasn’t even reading 1% of some of them. I would go through all my feeds
and folders and mark everything as read every few days<sup id="fnref:too-long"><a href="#fn:too-long" class="footnote">1</a></sup> just to keep up and feel like I
wasn’t overwhelmed.</p>

<p>I got rid of feeds from sites like <a href="http://www.lamebook.com/">Lamebook</a>, which is hilarious, but I don’t need to
read every single item, and <a href="http://www.absolutepunk.net/">Absolute Punk</a>, which is a great source for music news, but I only
want to read a very small portion of those stories. I get my fix from these sites by visiting them
every few days, not by trying to forge through a murky river of hundreds of RSS items that I don’t
want to read.</p>

<p>I now have 26 feeds in 8 categories,<sup id="fnref:cross-link"><a href="#fn:cross-link" class="footnote">2</a></sup> down from twice that before pruning. This is
manageable. 50+ high-traffic feeds are not. I can read the items from these feeds quickly, and I
can finally read “all items” without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<h2 id="netnewswire-revisited-again">NetNewsWire, revisited (again)</h2>

<p>I mentioned that I had used NetNewsWire before, but it never stuck. A couple of weeks ago, I saw
<a href="http://collindonnell.com/2012/06/29/my-netnewswire-window/">this NetNewsWire setup</a> and knew I had to try it. <code>⌘-⇧-R</code> and <code>⌘-/</code> are now my favorite
keyboard shortcuts. Refresh, and then scroll through my unread river of items. I sort
chronologically so I read posts “in order,” but I don’t think it actually matters much at all.
Since I have a low number of feeds, it usually only takes a few minutes to travel through these
unread items. Any links to things I want to check out in more depth later get a quick <code>^-P</code> to send
to Instapaper.</p>

<h2 id="reeder-on-mobile">Reeder on mobile</h2>

<p>I was recently on vacation without my MacBook, but I had my iPad and still wanted to keep up with my
news and feeds. There are plenty of other times that I’m without my computer but have a chance to
catch up on my reading. I figured (or hoped, really) that I could make the experience of reading
news on my iPhone and iPad just as great as it is with NetNewsWire at my desk.</p>

<p>I had heard great things about <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> on iOS, but I was skeptical that it could work for
me. It turns out I can get nearly the same river of news setup as NetNewsWire in Reeder. Unread
items can be sorted in chronological order, and moving to the next item is just a matter of swiping
up.</p>

<p>The end result is that I have a streamlined way to catch up on news that’s important to me as
quickly as possible, no matter where I am. I spend less time fiddling with news items I don’t really
care about, less time out of my day being distracted by the latest hot article,<sup id="fnref:distract"><a href="#fn:distract" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and more
time doing what I want and need to do.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:too-long">
      <p>I did this ritual for far too long before I realized it needed to end. Old habits die hard. <a href="#fnref:too-long" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:cross-link">
      <p>I’ve noticed that a lot of sites and blogs I read will “cross-post” each other’s items. This sounds like it might be annoying to have to read about the same things in multiple places, but usually one of two things happens: either the cross-posting contains a bit of insightful back-and-forth on a topic, or multiple people link to a great article elsewhere that I know I need to check out. I get to follow great discussions and the cream of the hot topic crop rises to the top of my news readers. Win-win for me. <a href="#fnref:cross-link" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:distract">
      <p>If only I could figure out how to stop checking <a href="http://stellar.io/">Stellar</a> so much. <a href="#fnref:distract" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I don’t think I’ll be using my Keurig much anymore.</p>

<p>I’m extremely late to this party, but I only recently discovered Aerobie’s <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/aeropress.htm">Aeropress</a>
coffee maker.  Yes, the company that created <a href="http://aerobie.com/products/pro.htm">those amazing ring-shaped flying discs</a>
also sells a weird-looking coffee maker. This plunger-like contraption helps to brew what is
probably the best cup of coffee I have ever tasted.</p>

<p>At first glance, it’s similar to a French press, but because the coffee is forced through a paper
filter instead of a coarser wire mesh, there is little to no sediment in the resulting liquid. The
coffee is described as “espresso-strength,” and I drink it as an Americano by adding a volume of
water equal to two times the amount of espresso. I’ve made Aeropress coffe with dark and lighter
roasts, and every cup of coffee has been exquisite.</p>

<p>If you enjoy coffee <em>at all</em>, I highly suggest you acquire an Aeropress as soon as possible. Once
you taste its delicious brew, you’ll understand why. It’s inexpensive, quick, easy to clean, and
delicious. There are no downsides.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You’re likely to be more comfortable with many situations if you know the rules of the environment
you’re in, including knowing its bounds and how flexible they are. </p>

<p>It sounds so obvious when it’s printed on the page in front of you, but if you’re more familiar with
a situation, it frees up your mind to focus on other things that you need to do or are good at.  You
stop worrying about whether you’re within the acceptable bounds of your current situation and just
do what you’re good at. “Apprehension” is usually just a term we use when we come across a situation
that we don’t quite fully understand.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the security lines at most American airports. If you place someone in that
situation who has never been there before, it would most likely be very overwhelming. There are
uniformed people with badges who don’t quite look like police, everyone is taking off their shoes,
but not before they hand two important documents to one of the faux-police, and then you have to
walk next to these weird doorway things but there are two kinds and one you have to pause in the
middle and turn sideways and oh yeah you remembered to take <em>everything</em> out of your pockets before
this, right? It’s overwhelming to someone who’s not familiar. To someone who travels often, however,
it’s positively rote.</p>

<p>Clearly, you don’t need to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">spend ten thousand hours</a> going through security lines to
become comfortable with air travel. Even one experience where you’re out of your element but aware
of your surroundings helps to prepare you for the next time. It’s obvious that the more you know
something, the better you are at it. But <em>so many</em> people seem to not take the time to learn the
rules and boundaries and then continually “wing it” while being overly-anxious.</p>

<p>An article I recently read about <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303836404577474451463041994.html">how some anxiety is necessary</a> might initially seem like
it’s a counterpoint to this, but there’s a big difference between being prepared and being
complacent. Even that article mentions that you have to get the balance just right lest you become
lazy. Sports are a great example here. You have to know the game you’re playing inside and out <em>and</em>
have finely-honed fundamental skills so you can focus most or all of your thinking on strategy or on
the dynamic parts of the game that your instincts cannnot help with.</p>

<p>Even “simple” things, like how to interact in social situations, can be made easier if you think
about the rules. It’s probably not a good idea to talk about that weird rash on your lower back, but
it is a good idea to talk about a great beer you tried recently, or how the playoffs are going, or
that you’re thinking about getting a dog. The basic rule there is “don’t be creepy.”</p>

<p>The hard part is knowing the rules in the first place. That comes through experience, and sometimes
a little research – Googling, asking your friends or family – beforehand comes in handy.</p>
